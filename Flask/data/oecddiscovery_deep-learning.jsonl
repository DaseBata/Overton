Change is not an extra, but a pedagogical problem-solving process that builds on the creative, intuitive and personal capacities of teachers.The new OECD publication, Teachers as Designers of Learning Environments: The Importance of Innovative Pedagogies, aims to help teachers navigate the huge number of promising practices and new approaches within the innovation landscape.

The time and monetary costs of student appeals makes it imperative that medical schools adopt robust quality assured assessment processes. The success of these processes depends on the ability of faculty to determine the necessary changes required and manage the change process. Openness to change is critical; therefore, identifying the processes that facilitate staff openness constitutes an important step in better understanding how higher education institutions can ensure that staff members are willing to support and engage in change initiatives.

The report compares teacher-directed instruction and memorisation learning strategies, at the traditional ends of the teaching and learning spectrums, and student-oriented instruction and elaboration learning strategies, at the opposite ends. Other teaching strategies, such as formative assessment and cognitive activation, and learning approaches, such as control strategies, are also analysed. Our analyses suggest that to perform at the top, students cannot rely on memory alone; they need to approach mathematics strategically and creatively to succeed in the most complex problems. There is also some evidence that most teaching strategies have a role to play in the classroom.

The transition finance ABC methodology, part of the transition finance toolkit, provides methodological guidance, metrics, data references and analytical interpretation for users to conduct transition finance diagnostics and country studies.The paper is organised along the sections: assessing, benchmarking and counselling. The first section, assessment, outlines an economic and socio-political mapping of the country and helps to identify the specific transition a country is undergoing. Benchmarking, section two, helps to form country peer groups and contrast development finance to these countries. Building on the analytical results from the first two sections, the last section on counselling gives exemplary policy guidance to respond to the observed transition challenges.", "published_on": "2020-02-17", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/c5210d6c-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/98e1ac75be2c70e05be010227885d377.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/98e1ac75be2c70e05be010227885d377.png", "topics": ["World economy", "Finance", "Economy", "Tax", "Public finance", "Inflation", "Real interest rate", "Debt", "Interest rate", "Development Assistance Committee", "Government debt", "Official development assistance", "Gross domestic product", "Sustainable Development Goals", "Current account (balance of payments)", "Balance of payments", "Sustainability", "Exchange rate", "Capital account", "Development aid", "Foreign direct investment", "International Monetary Fund", "Economic development", "Money", "Interest", "Economics", "Bank", "Investment", "Public\u2013private partnership", "Business", "OECD", "Trade", "Competition (economics)", "Economic growth", "Least developed countries", "International relations", "Economies", "Aid", "International development"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "politics", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics", "science and technology>social sciences", "economy, business and finance>economy", "science and technology", "politics>government", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics>credit and debt", "science and technology>social sciences>economics"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Working paper", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/c5210d6c-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1093/oxrep/grv029", "title": "Aid and domestic resource mobilization with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa", "journal": "Oxford Review of Economic Policy", "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.rdf.2016.06.001", "title": "Does development finance pose an additional risk to monetary policy?", "journal": "Review of Development Finance", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1787/5daa24c1-en-fr", "title": "Revenue Statistics in Africa 2019", "journal": "Revenue statistics in Africa", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264287648-en", "title": "Making Development Co-operation Work for Small Island Developing States", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.euroecorev.2010.12.006", "title": "Cross-country causes and consequences of the crisis: An update", "journal": "European Economic Review", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1787/feb640fe-en", "title": "Transition Finance Challenges for Commodity-based Least Developed Countries", "journal": "OECD Development Co-operation Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/1c142aae-en", "title": "Blended Finance in the Least Developed Countries 2019", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264302075-en", "title": "States of Fragility 2018", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.rdf.2016.05.001", "title": "The determinants of financial inclusion in Africa", "journal": "Review of Development Finance", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1787/3cb86a6c-en", "title": "Transition Finance Country Study Viet Nam", "journal": "OECD Development Co-operation Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.rdf.2018.05.005", "title": "Sub-Saharan African Eurobond yields: What really matters beyond global factors?", "journal": "Review of Development Finance", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.3917/edd.hs01.0217", "title": "Aid Effectiveness for Poverty Reduction: Lessons from Cross?country Analyses, with a Special Focus on Vulnerable Countries", "journal": "Revue d'\u00e9conomie du d\u00e9veloppement", "publisher": "CAIRN"}, {"doi": "10.1332/030557307779657739", "title": "Out of the shadows?

Preparing young people to meet new contemporary challenges means to review and update the pedagogies teachers use. However, despite the increased reporting of teachers and schools that are innovating, schools remain largely seen as very resistant places for innovation.

In doing so, it helps explain how innovative pedagogies may be developed, applied and scaled.

The meta-analysis of 20 quantitative studies revealed significant effects for teaching quality and student outcomes (Cohen\u2019s d = .64 and .26), indicating that more knowledgeable teachers achieve a three-month additional progress for students. The three themes emerging from 31 qualitative studies underline that general pedagogical knowledge is a crucial resource for teaching. Results also show that teaching requires knowledge about a range of topics, specific skills and other competences to transform knowledge into practice. Teachers need training and practical experience to acquire knowledge, which they apply according to the pedagogical situation at hand. The results allow for important conclusions for policy, practice and research.", "published_on": "2019-12-20", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/ede8feb6-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/93aace6158a2009c51b542f5af0609c1.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/93aace6158a2009c51b542f5af0609c1.png", "topics": ["Evaluation", "Publication bias", "Curriculum", "Procedural knowledge", "Research question", "Knowledge", "Classroom management", "Reading", "Learning", "Qualitative research", "Effect size", "Teacher education", "Quantitative research", "Educational assessment", "Pedagogy", "Research", "Education", "Teacher", "Validity (statistics)", "Self-report study", "Experience", "Branches of science", "Methodology", "Cognition", "Behavior modification", "Cognitive science", "Science", "Classroom", "Teaching method", "Errors and residuals", "Evidence", "Metacognition", "Self-concept", "School", "Analysis", "Concepts in metaphysics", "Bias", "Empirical evidence", "Data", "Neuropsychological assessment", "Scientific method", "Belief", "Psychological concepts", "Mentorship", "Mediation", "Empirical research", "Systematic review", "Meta-analysis", "Theory"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["education", "education>school", "science and technology", "education>school>further education", "science and technology>mathematics"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Working paper", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/ede8feb6-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1016/j.tate.2010.06.001", "title": "How do teachers reason about their practice?

The focus is on enquiry-based science teaching, teacher-directed instruction, adaptive teaching and teacher feedback. The outcomes of interest include students\u2019 science performance, and students\u2019 dispositions and attitudes towards science. The findings show that the negative association between enquiry-based science teaching and science performance is greatly attenuated when lessons are delivered in disciplined science classes. This approach could help close the gender gap between girls and boys when it comes to attitudes towards science and to the decision to pursue a career in STEM-related fields. The results also show that teacher-directed instruction is a reliable strategy that is positively associated with students\u2019 science outcomes regardless of school climate and resources. Adaptive teaching is positively correlated with science performance in the majority of countries, pa...", "published_on": "2018-11-19", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/f5bd9e57-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/24589b871c01b1eb144a512d5c78e1c5.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/24589b871c01b1eb144a512d5c78e1c5.png", "topics": ["Cognition", "Logistic regression", "Self-efficacy", "Scientific method", "Educational assessment", "Student-centered learning", "Science", "Learning", "Constructivism (philosophy of education)", "Inquiry-based learning", "Education", "Teacher", "Programme for International Student Assessment", "Differentiated instruction", "Experiment", "Curriculum", "Knowledge", "School", "Scientific literacy", "Regression analysis", "Classroom", "Health professional", "Socioeconomic status", "Literacy", "Branches of science", "Pedagogy", "Motivation", "Percentile", "Questionnaire", "Linear regression", "Statistics", "Item response theory", "Behavior modification", "Simple linear regression", "Science education"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["education", "science and technology", "health", "education>school>further education", "education>school", "science and technology>mathematics"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Working paper", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/f5bd9e57-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1787/9789264040892-en", "title": "Encouraging Student Interest in Science and Technology Studies", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1037/0003-066x.59.1.14", "title": "Should There Be a Three-Strikes Rule Against Pure Discovery Learning?", "journal": "American Psychologist", "publisher": "American Psychological Association (APA)"}, {"doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2729.2004.00092.x", "title": "The effects of discovery learning and expository instruction on the acquisition of definitional and intuitive knowledge", "journal": "Journal of Computer Assisted Learning", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.cedpsych.2015.12.003", "title": "Dropping out of high school: The role of parent and teacher self-determination support, reciprocal friendships and academic motivation", "journal": "Contemporary Educational Psychology", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1177/13684310222225432", "title": "Toward a Theory of Social Practices", "journal": "European Journal of Social Theory", "publisher": "SAGE Publications"}, {"doi": "10.1002/sce.10044", "title": "Inquiry projects in science teacher education: What can investigative experiences reveal about teacher thinking and eventual classroom practice?", "journal": "Science Education", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1080/01619569209538671", "title": "Teaching practices and class size: A new look at an old issue", "journal": "Peabody Journal of Education", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264266490-en", "title": "PISA 2015 Results (Volume I)", "journal": "PISA", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264285521-en", "title": "PISA 2015 Results (Volume V)", "journal": "PISA", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1111/obes.12192", "title": "Virtually No Effect?

Skilled people play a crucial role in innovation through the new knowledge they generate, how they adopt and develop existing ideas, and through their ability to learn new competencies and adapt to a changing environment.This book seeks to increase understanding of the links between skills and innovation. It explores the wide range of skills required, ranging from technical to \"soft\", and the ability to learn; it presents data and evidence on countries' stocks and flows of skills and the links between skill inputs and innovation outputs. Given the importance of meeting the demands of knowledge-based economic activity, the book investigates the issues of skill supply, education, workplace training and work organisation. It highlights the importance of enabling individuals to acquire appropriate skills and of optimising these at work.", "published_on": "2011-02-04", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264097490-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/deb5a0557438de2f97b15a31491a1333.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/deb5a0557438de2f97b15a31491a1333.png", "topics": ["Economy", "Cognition", "Science", "Technology", "Labour economics", "Capital (economics)", "International student", "Sustainability", "Strategic management", "Economic growth", "Green job", "Research", "Creativity", "Employment", "Literacy", "Productivity", "Education", "Entrepreneurship", "Human capital", "Innovation", "Low-carbon economy", "Social capital", "Leadership", "Absorptive capacity", "Green economy", "Market (economics)", "Design", "Soft skills", "Vocational education", "Marketing", "Numeracy", "Research and development", "OECD", "Branches of science", "Economics", "Skill", "Globalization", "Information and communications technology", "Communication", "Problem solving", "Emission intensity", "Higher education", "Startup company", "Resource", "Business", "Reading", "Management", "Health", "Strategy", "Training"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "education", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economy", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology", "health"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/9789264097490-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1787/5kmh8phxvvf5-en", "title": "Careers of Doctorate Holders", "journal": "OECD Science, Technology and Industry Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264179967-ko", "title": "Learning for Jobs", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264059474-en", "title": "Measuring Innovation", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/237755412637", "title": "Job-Related Training and Benefits for Individuals", "journal": "OECD Education Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264181816-en", "title": "From Initial Education to Working Life", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264192263-en", "title": "Proposed Guidelines for Collecting and Interpreting Technological Innovation Data", "journal": "The Measurement of Scientific and Technological Activities", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264046535-en", "title": "Tertiary Education for the Knowledge Society", "journal": "OECD Reviews of Tertiary Education", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264026780-en", "title": "The Economic Impact of ICT", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/c8705713-en", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264077485-en", "title": "The High Cost of Low Educational Performance", "journal": "PISA", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264025387-en", "title": "Women in Scientific Careers", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264095687-en", "title": "Innovative Workplaces", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264189515-en", "title": "The Well-being of Nations", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264208155-en", "title": "Ageing and Employment Policies: Netherlands 2014", "journal": "Ageing and Employment Policies/Vieillissement et politiques de l'emploi: Sweden 2003", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264032477-en", "title": "Babies and Bosses -

Students appear in various guises as citizens, consumers, and clients. They are fitting university study around increasingly busy lives, often alongside paid employment.

In this regard it is\ninteresting to compare the observations made at the Brisbane and Paris seminars\nwith those made by Professor Richard J. Light, of the Graduate School of Education\nat Harvard University, in his recent and widely acclaimed book Making the Most of\nCollege: Students Speak Their Minds. In this book, Light reported on his findings from\nthirty years in higher education and the results of ten years of surveying Harvard\nseniors on their educational experience. While the US higher education scene differs\nsignificantly from that in Australia, for example, in the structural diversity of\neducation providers, the tradition of on-campus residence, and the prominence of\nracial diversity as a contentious issue, many of the findings and recommendations\nare familiar. In particular, he highlights the need to improve the relevance and \u201cfit\u201d\nof higher education to the wider lives of students. He cites one dean as saying that\nhis job was simply to recruit the best students and get out of their way. Light\nargues strongly that colleges and universities should not just get out of the way,\nand indeed that it should be an obligation of institutions of higher education to\nprovide challenging experiences for students which engage them in the life of the\nuniversity and the wider world, and which stretch their expectations. He further\nhighlighted the importance of engaging with students in the first few weeks of the\nacademic year. Undoubtedly it would be easier to achieve these sorts of changes\nif we all had the resources of Harvard University, but few of the examples Light\nuses involve a massive commitment of resources. More fundamentally they\ninvolve a commitment to the notion of student-centred learning. This has become\nsomething of a catch-phrase which is easily misinterpreted as treating students\nlike clients or customers. Rather, it should mean treating student learning as a\nclear goal of university education, and structuring it accordingly, making it the\nbusiness of the university to understand student needs and to respond appropriately,\nand treating students with the respect they deserve and demand."}]}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "Second, they recognize that even when learners dohave a desire to learn, their individual learning styles differ.

The Innovative Teaching for Effective Learning Teacher Knowledge Survey (ITEL TKS) set out to answer this question in a pilot study that ran in five countries: Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Israel and the Slovak Republic.

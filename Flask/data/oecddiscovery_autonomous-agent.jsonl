Can student assessment help make curricula more relevant? How can further training for teachers make their teaching more effective? These questions lie at the heart of curriculum reform, which is unanimously ranked among the top priorities in education, but often approached too narrowly.To be truly effective, curricula must be fully consistent with both teaching practice and education policy. They must also equip students for the challenge of lifelong learning.

Following\nthe Dewey tradition, the shortcoming of technical rationality were early\npointed out in the work of Schwab and McKeon at the University of Chicago in the\n1960s (Reid, 1994); they advocated an Aristotelian approach based on practical reasoning\nin identifying and solving problems. The object here is not to espouse a particular\napproach but rather to indicate that a point has been reached where the\nadoption of another paradigm may be emerging.

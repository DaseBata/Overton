According to observers, after COSCO acquired 51% of the port of Piraeus in 2016, the Greek government objected to the EU statement in 2017 at the UN concerning humanrights violations in China. Piraeus has become the busiest port in the Mediterranean and the 4th busiest in Europe (up from 17th place in 2017). Another recent case that created much debate was the acquisition by the Chinese firm COSCO of a stake in one terminal at the port of Hamburg. Due to serious concerns within the German Federal Government about the strategic implications of the acquisition, the German cabinet decided to reduce COSCO\u2019s stake from the 35% originally envisaged to 24.9%. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-un-rights/greece-blocks-eu-statement-on-china-human-rights-at-u-n-idUSKBN1990FP", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-un-rights/greece-blocks-eu-statement-on-china-human-rights-at-u-n-idUSKBN1990FP", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Ivanova, P., Smith, C. and Wigglesworth, R.

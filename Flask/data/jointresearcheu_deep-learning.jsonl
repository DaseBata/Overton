Based on the development of research projects on these two fields, this paper will compare the two sets of competencies. It will describe how the values and dispositions that motivate and inform civic competence and learning to learn are related to each other, both empirically and theoretically. Both these competences are tools for empowering the individual and giving them the motivation, autonomy and responsibility to control their own lives beyond the social circumstances in which they find themselves.

Many parameters can be measured and analysed to assess the potential of the test chemical to cause adverse effects in the test animals and predict potential adverse effects in humans.

Here we analysed the parameters measured in animal studies and attempted to map these to more mechanistically informative endpoints. The study was conducted by collecting relevant mechanistic data from literature, public and private databases. The scope was limited to the liver, cardiovascular system, kidney and lung, and the oral route of exposure. The ultimate goal was to better understand the nature of chronic toxicity to facilitate and expedite the development of human-centric non-animal prediction models.

City dwellers are more often exposed to air pollution, noise and heavy traffic than people living outside urban areas. Cities are also a prime source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. A large part of these emissions comes from transport. Moving away from inefficient and polluting transport modes is one possible way of reducing these societal burdens. Exploring 'first mile' and 'last mile' mobility options, which may be used to complete a journey by public transport, for example, can help make this shift happen by increasing the attractiveness and efficiency of sustainable modes of transport. 'Only mile' options for travelling very short distances can also help. We gather these first/last/only mile modes under the label F/L/O mile options.

Energy is an essential element of economic growth both directly (all economic processes require energy) and indirectly (energy availability at low cost and the use of different energy types drive innovations and promote efficiency). As the transition involves the substitution of capital for fossil energy, it requires a shift towards more up-front capital spending in return for lower operating costs.

In some risk matters, across and within sectors, the European regulation is more stringent, whereas in others it is the US.

Still regulatory variation can also be the basis for learning to improve future regulatory design, both by comparing outcomes across regulations in different jurisdictions, and by planning adaptive regulation over time.

The study was based on four key inputs: Interviews with administrations and other stakeholders in all 28 Member States; An examination of available data concerning the elements used in authorisations and assignments and the impacts of those elements on the mobile industry and markets; The analysis of four use-case scenarios which represent possible development paths for 5G services. These use cases were validated and reinforced by an expert academic panel; A public workshop where delegates contributed to the development and analysis of the scenarios.

Many of the technologies demonstrating high potential in reducing CO2 and market uptake in the near future (e.g. aero devices for trailers and bodies and hybrid electric powertrains) are currently being implemented in VECTO. The next steps can include zero-emission vehicles, such as fuel cell vehicles, and technologies that could be easily implemented.", "published_on": "2021-04-13", "added_on": "2021-04-19", "document_url": "https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/273d921c-9ccc-11eb-b85c-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=273d921c-9ccc-11eb-b85c-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/43739ad892f670ccf3f7a43bb83608b3.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/43739ad892f670ccf3f7a43bb83608b3.png", "topics": ["Hybrid vehicle drivetrain", "Engine", "Hybrid vehicle", "Energy-efficient driving", "Internal combustion engine", "Tire", "Electric vehicle", "Powertrain", "Electric car", "Hybrid electric vehicle", "Fuel economy in automobiles", "Vehicle", "Exhaust gas", "Axle", "Compressor", "Carbon-neutral fuel", "Fuel cell", "Tire-pressure monitoring system", "Cruise control", "Trailer (vehicle)", "Plug-in hybrid", "Dual-clutch transmission", "Battery electric vehicle", "Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning", "Combustion", "Waste heat", "Rolling resistance", "Continuously variable transmission", "Self-driving car", "Pump", "Fuel", "Intercooler", "Truck", "Mild hybrid", "Manufactured goods", "Technology", "Transport", "Transportation engineering", "Energy", "Mechanical engineering", "Vehicle technology", "Vehicles", "Transmission (mechanics)", "Hydraulic hybrid vehicle", "Steering", "Wheel", "Heat recovery ventilation", "Variable displacement", "Clutch", "Fuel cell vehicle", "Aerodynamics", "Dynamometer", "Simulation", "European Union", "Power steering", "Carbon dioxide", "Air compressor", "Air pollution", "Vortex generator", "Traffic", "Brake", "Physical quantities", "Compressed-air energy storage", "Electrical resistance and conductance", "Energy management", "Motor vehicles", "Advanced driver-assistance systems", "Machines", "Speed limiter"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>energy and resource", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>transport>road transport", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>transport", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>energy and resource>diesel fuel"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": [" Catalogue number KJ-NA-30658-EN-N ", "10.2760/985739", "9789276340249", " ISSN "], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2790/10868", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.energy.2016.02.076", "title": "An experimental evaluation of the methodology proposed for the monitoring and certification of CO2 emissions from heavy-duty vehicles in Europe", "journal": "Energy", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}], "policy": [{"overton_id": "europa-80e7965976ea184ab4824b2894d230c9", "title": "Report on VECTO technology simulation capabilities and future outlook.", "policy_source_id": "europa"}], "news": [], "people": [{"person": "Georgios Fontaras", "affiliation": "Joint Research Centre", "snippet": "Name: Georgios Fontaras\nAddress: European Commission, Joint Research centre (JRC), Via E.

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) comprised around 0.6 % of all new car registrations in the EU in 2017 (EEA, 2018a). By 2030, BEVs could be between 3.9 % and 13.0 % of new car registrations, depending on the EU-wide fleet average CO2 target levels set for passenger cars in the future (EC, 2017a). There is, therefore, an increasing need to understand BEVs from a systems perspective. This involves an in-depth consideration of the environmental impact of the product using life cycle assessment (LCA) as well as taking a broader 'circular economy' approach. On the one hand, LCA is a means of assessing the environmental impact associated with all stages of a product's life from cradle to grave: from raw material extraction and processing to the product's manufacture to its use in everyday life and finally to its end of life. On the other hand, the concept of a circular economy considers impacts and in turn solutions across the whole societal system. In a traditional linear economy products are made, used and then disposed of, whereas in a circular economy the value of materials and products is kept as high as possible for as long as possible (EEA, 2017b). This, in turn, helps reduce requirements for new materials and energy needs, ameliorating environmental pressures. Additional aspects that can be considered within the circular economy concept (e.g. Jackson, 2017; Kopnina, 2017; Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2018) include the use of renewable energy and sustainable consumption, e.g. through the shared ownership of goods. Reflecting their relevance to BEVs, these additional aspects are also considered in this report. The aims of this report are to: - bring together existing evidence on the environmental impact of BEVs across the stages of their life cycle, undertaking where possible comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs); - consider how a move to a circular economy could reduce these impacts.", "published_on": "2018-12-18", "added_on": "2019-07-23", "document_url":

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) comprised around 0.6 % of all new car registrations in the EU in 2017 (EEA, 2018a). By 2030, BEVs could be between 3.9 % and 13.0 % of new car registrations, depending on the EU-wide fleet average CO2 target levels set for passenger cars in the future (EC, 2017a). There is, therefore, an increasing need to understand BEVs from a systems perspective. This involves an in-depth consideration of the environmental impact of the product using life cycle assessment (LCA) as well as taking a broader 'circular economy' approach. On the one hand, LCA is a means of assessing the environmental impact associated with all stages of a product's life from cradle to grave: from raw material extraction and processing to the product's manufacture to its use in everyday life and finally to its end of life.

Electricity is found to be an increasingly important energy carrier in final energy consumption already in the absence of stronger climate policies than those currently in place (Reference scenario), while enhanced electrification of final energy demand is a crucial element of the 2\u00b0C temperature change scenario, paving the way to climate neutrality. The 2\u00b0C target could be achieved by simultaneously transforming various elements of the energy system: shifting final energy demand from mainly fossil fuels towards electricity and low-carbon synthetic fuels mainly derived from electricity; decarbonising power generation; increasing energy efficiency in end-uses, which is favoured by further electrification; and mobilising novel options to better accommodate high shares of intermittent renewable electricity sources, such as demand-sid...", "published_on": "2020-03-06", "added_on": "2020-03-16", "document_url":

It is expected that this trend will continue. Bricks and mortar (B&amp;M) retailers have reacted to the increasing share of e-commerce retail leading to an increasing merger of both retail modes into an omnichannel retail. These shifts in retail channels are inevitably accompanied by changes in the transport system. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to assess the environmental impact of e-commerce along the value chain compared with B&amp;M retail. To assess the environmental impacts of both retail modes, each single transport leg relevant for either the e-commerce or the B&amp;M transport chain needed to be examined individually. Therefore, a transport chain analysis was carried out in the first step. In a second step, a modelling tool was established to calculate the environmental impact of each leg.

The report includes a chapter on regional analysis, which provides an overview of the main socioeconomic features of all EU sea basins and some examples of smart specialisation. Finally, the Report develops the analysis of the underlying factors driving the evolution of the EU Blue Economy. Aside from details for each sector, an overview of the general macroeconomic situation as well as the influence of global financial markets over the trends in financing and investments has been incorporated. The report focuses on the evolution of the EU Blue Economy over time. The differences in the figures with respect to last year\u2019s report can be explained by a combination of real growth and the statistical effect of including additional sectors. For instance, last year showed 3.5 million jobs for the EU Blue Economy established sectors and this year the data showed 4 million jobs. This is partly due to an increase in scope and improved methodology and partly due to actual economic growth. Differences for aggregated turnover are larger as a result of double counting effects within the various value chains of the Blue Economy (e.g. fishing \u2013 processing \u2013 commercialisation, marine equipment and machinery \u2013 shipbuilding \u2013 maritime transport). The Blue Economy\u2019s long-term potential in terms of jobs, growth and investments can only be completely realised if more effective and coordinated steps are taken to bring together environmental, economic and social aspects of ocean management. This assessment of the state and scope of the Blue Economy and investment opportunities is intended to support policy and decision-making, and provide direction in ocean stewardship and governance.",

This report summarises a range of vehicle life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies available in the public domain, which were found to be of varying focus, data quality, detail and coverage. It develops a policymaker-oriented LCA methodology for light- and heavy-duty vehicles covering a selection of major powertrain types and fuel chains for the 2020 to 2050 timeframe. The study has combined state-of-the art vehicle LCA with novel methodological choices to develop results for a range of environmental impacts for 14 electricity chains, 60 fuel chains, and 65 generic vehicle/powertrain combinations across 7 vehicle types.

Temperatures continue to break records and climate-related extreme events are more frequent and more intense. Europeans continue to call for stronger climate action even in the current health and economic crisis resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. This means higher ambition on both mitigation and on adaptation to climate change. The impacts on people, planet and prosperity are already pervasive but unevenly distributed across the globe. In 2018, most of the natural hazards affecting nearly 62 million people globally were associated with extreme weather and climate events. Out of 17.2 million new displacements associated with disasters in 2018, 16.1 million were weather related.

The study has established indicators to measure the main features affecting the development of the collaborative economy. It has developed a \u201cCollaborative Economy Index\u201d to benchmark the business environment. Based on the Index results, the study puts forward suggestions for the further development of the collaborative economy in the EU. The study concludes that there is no single approach for creating a favourable regulatory environment for the collaborative economy, as most regulations affect both conventional and collaborative economy actors. Clear definitions for collaborative economy services along with a distinction between peer and professional activities (e.g. through thresholds) facilitate collaborative economy activities.

The OECD's AI and the Future of Skills (AIFS) project is developing a comprehensive framework for regularly measuring AI capabilities and comparing them to human skills. The resulting AI indicators should help policymakers anticipate AI\u2019s impacts on education and work.This volume describes the second phase of the project: exploring three different approaches to assessing AI. First, the project explored the use of education tests for the assessment by asking computer experts to evaluate AI\u2019s performance on OECD\u2019s tests in reading, mathematics and science. Second, the project extended the rating of AI capabilities to tests used to certify workers for occupations. These tests present complex practical tasks and are potentially useful for understanding the application of AI in the workplace. Third, the project explored measures from direct AI evaluations.

In the OECD National Survey for Comparative Policy Analysis 2023: Empowering Learners to go Green, 90% of participating systems identified environmental sustainability as a key priority for 2024.

As a result, countries are looking to strengthen these opportunities throughout the life course.

This paper provides an overview of quality assurance mechanisms from the perspective of the 38 OECD member countries. It proposes a framework to characterise and compare the governance, processes and outcomes of these mechanisms. The paper's contribution is to facilitate understanding of quality assurance across OECD countries, presenting a visual cross-country mapping that classifies existing mechanisms.", "published_on":

It is based on nearly 100 case studies of the impacts of AI technologies on workplaces in the manufacturing and finance sectors of eight OECD countries. The study shows that, to date, job reorganisation appears more prevalent than job displacement, with automation prompting the reorientation of jobs towards tasks in which humans have a comparative advantage. Job quality improvements associated with AI \u2013 reductions in tedium, greater worker engagement, and improved physical safety \u2013 may be its strongest endorsement from a worker perspective.

The cross-country chapters examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on housing demand, develop a proposal for a green land value tax, evaluate the dynamics between fiscal autonomy and housing supply responsiveness, as well as explore the drivers of inter-regional migration. The case studies unravel the changes of Korea's progressive national property tax and a programme to address regional imbalances, assess the impact of the US property tax system on housing, dive into Norway's property taxation in relation to inequality, as well as survey Belgium's approaches to housing policy. With a blend of empirical data and critical analysis, the report underscores the pressing need for comprehensive strategies in addressing housing inequities. It also offers insights for policymakers and scholars, highlighting the complex balance between national and local housing policies.", "published_on": "2023-10-26", "added_on": "2023-11-08", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1787/7a22f9a6-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/e2d27362e6f56c2fd81c6da4ca4cfbeb.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/e2d27362e6f56c2fd81c6da4ca4cfbeb.png", "topics": ["Economy", "Governance", "Renting", "Government spending", "Rent regulation", "Property", "Income inequality in the United States", "Tax deduction", "Mortgage loan", "Fixed effects model", "Fiscal policy", "Interest", "Personal income", "Demand", "Policy", "Remote work", "Gross domestic product", "Income distribution", "Distribution of wealth", "Labour economics", "Redistribution of income and wealth", "Real estate economics", "Market (economics)", "Public housing", "Wealth", "Real estate appraisal", "Welfare", "Economic growth", "Land value tax", "Public finance", "Poverty", "Income", "Affordable housing", "Gini coefficient", "Property tax", "Economic inequality", "Tax", "Valuation (finance)", "Decentralization", "OECD", "Price elasticity of demand", "Norway", "COVID-19 pandemic", "Tax revenue", "Price", "Leasehold estate", "Correlation", "Tax rate", "Median", "Metropolitan area", "Tax incidence", "Taxation in Norway", "Economics", "Homelessness", "Internet"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>financial and business service", "economy, business and finance>economy", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>financial and business service>personal income"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/7a22f9a6-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1353/urb.2006.0013", "title": "Property Tax Limitations and Mobility: Lock-in Effect of California's Proposition 13", "journal": "Brookings-Wharton Papers on Urban Affairs", "publisher": "Project Muse"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.labeco.2006.01.001", "title": "Are housing benefit an effective way to redistribute income?

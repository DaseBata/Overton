He criticised the White Paper's failure to introduce a joint EU/UK\nset of disciplines to ensure that the EU acquis is maintained. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)\nto the UK will suffer, as the appeal of access to EU27 will be diminished. Prof. Dr Friedemann\nKainer (University of Mannheim) said the ideal solution would be passporting, as liberalising\ntrade in services requires regulation, such as common standards for licences, allowing mutual\nrecognition. He suggested that the best solution for the future relation from a market point\nof view would be EEA membership. Regarding trade in goods, Prof. Dr Piet Eeckhout (University\nCollege London) explained that regulatory and tax barriers were comparable in EU\nand WTO law. He pointed out, however, that WTO law and EU law differ when it comes to\nmutual recognition and the harmonisation of technical regulations. The UK currently fully\ncomplies with the EU internal market acquis, but it might diverge from it in the future. The\nstarting point for the future relations could be to enable a system mutual recognition. However,\nthe EU acquis cannot survive without an independent arbitrator, but the UK does not\nwant to continue following the European Court of Justice (ECJ)."}, {"person": "Sue Arrowsmith", "affiliation": "University of Nottingham", "snippet": "11:35 \u2013 11:50 The consequences of Brexit on the public procurement: legal\nstandards for rights and obligations under different scenarios for\nexit and future cooperation agreement or lack thereof\nProfessor Dr. Sue Arrowsmith, University of Nottingham"}, {"person": "Fabian Amtenbrink", "affiliation": "Erasmus University Rotterdam", "snippet": "1.

It analyses the political and legal dynamics behind referendums on EU-related matters. It argues that we have entered a period of increasing political uncertainty with regard to the European project and that this new political configuration will both affect and be affected by the politics of EU-related referendums. Such referendums have long been a risky endeavour and this has been accentuated in the wake of the Great Recession with its negative ramifications for public opinion in the European Union. It is clear that referendums on EU matters are here to stay and will continue to be central to the EU\u2019s future as they are deployed to determine the number of Member States within the EU, its geographical reach, its constitutional evolution and adherence to EU policies.

Court of First Instance Brussels (in summary proceedings) 24 Jun. 2009). The publication of a\ndecision of the Press Council was prohibited by the President of the Brussels Court because of the nonopposability\nof the statutes of the Council to a journalist/blogger who is not a member of the journalists\u2019\nassociation.

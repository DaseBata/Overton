A dozen nosogeographical entities \u2013 characterised by different parasite, vector and reservoir host species, geographical distribution and clinical features in humans \u2013 affect 101 countries in tropical, subtropical and temperate zones of the world. More than 90% of 200 000 to 400 000 global cases of visceral leishmaniasis, the most severe form, are estimated to occur annually in India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Brazil. A less severe form, cutaneous leishmaniasis, is more widely distributed, accounting for 0.7-1.2 million cases each year in countries of Latin America, the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East and central Asia.", "published_on": "2013-10-21", "added_on": "2020-09-22", "document_url": "https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/48b8a279-9e9e-46d9-ad62-00b50eb07a04/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=48b8a279-9e9e-46d9-ad62-00b50eb07a04&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/f9cf19e258b57ead8785951b1e153cfc.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/f9cf19e258b57ead8785951b1e153cfc.png", "topics": ["Immunology", "Diseases and disorders", "Medical specialties", "Health sciences", "Medicine", "Health", "Clinical medicine", "Infectious diseases", "Epidemiology", "Dependent and independent variables", "Cutaneous leishmaniasis", "Canine leishmaniasis", "HIV/AIDS", "Infection", "Management of HIV/AIDS", "Visceral leishmaniasis", "Leishmaniasis", "Public health", "Croatian Littoral", "Natural reservoir", "Microbiology", "Medical diagnosis", "Leishmania donovani", "Disease", "Confidence interval", "Incidence (epidemiology)", "Health care", "HIV", "Immunodeficiency", "Zoonosis", "Epidemic", "Medical statistics", "Transmission (medicine)", "Croatia"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["science and technology", "science and technology>natural science", "health>diseases and conditions>illness", "health>diseases and conditions", "science and technology>natural science>biology", "health"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["TQ-AD-13-004-EN-C", "1025-496X"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1016/j.vetpar.2008.05.003", "title": "Characterization of widespread canine leishmaniasis among wild carnivores from Spain", "journal": "Veterinary Parasitology", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1128/cmr.00061-07", "title": "The Relationship between Leishmaniasis and AIDS: the Second 10 Years", "journal": "Clinical Microbiology Reviews", "publisher": "American Society for Microbiology"}, {"doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0035671", "title": "Leishmaniasis Worldwide and Global Estimates of Its Incidence", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "publisher": "Public Library of Science (PLoS)"}, {"doi": "10.2807/1560-7917.es2013.18.28.20532", "title": "Epidemiology of human leishmaniasis in Greece, 1981-2011", "journal": "Eurosurveillance", "publisher": "European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.jinf.2004.05.004", "title": "Human and canine leishmaniasis in asymptomatic and symptomatic population in Northwestern Greece", "journal": "Journal of Infection", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1051/parasite/1994012131", "title": "Sandflies in the Greater Athens Region, Greece", "journal": "Parasite", "publisher": "EDP Sciences"}, {"doi": "10.1080/00034983.1984.11811834", "title": "Isolation and identification of the parasite causing cutaneous leishmaniasis in man", "journal": "Annals of Tropical Medicine & Parasitology", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.actatropica.2011.05.012", "title": "Importance of worldwide asymptomatic carriers of Leishmania infantum (L. chagasi) in human", "journal": "Acta Tropica", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.2807/1560-7917.es2013.18.28.20533", "title": "Asymptomatic Leishmania infantum infections in humans living in endemic and non-endemic areas of Croatia, 2007 to 2009", "journal": "Eurosurveillance", "publisher": "European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)"}, {"doi": "10.7205/milmed-d-58-5608", "title": "Occurence of Visceral and Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Croatia", "journal": "Military Medicine", "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}, {"doi": "10.1590/s0074-02761997000500002", "title": "Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Venezuela Caused by Infection with a New Hybrid between Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis and L.

From an LCA perspective, the main environmental impact was found to be related to energy consumption during the use phase. This impact can be reduced in a number of ways, by using luminaire and light source combinations with a high luminous efficacy, by dimming during periods of low road use and by selection of the lowest necessary light class for roads to prevent unnecessary over-lighting in the first place. Light pollution is another environmental impact of particular relevance to road lighting and traffic signals which is not well addressed by LCA methodologies.

In addition to pharmaceutical applications, flow chemistry is expanding into organometallic chemistry, fine chemicals, polymers, peptides, nanomaterials, and energetic materials synthesis. In Chapter 2 of this report, we review the principles of flow chemistry, and highlight the potential benefits compared to performing reactions in batch mode. For example, flow reactors facilitate the fast dissipation of heat created during highly exothermic reactions, such as mixing of sulfuric-nitric acid, nitration reactions, or possible side reactions such as oxidation of nitro-aromatic compounds. Heat transfer rate in flow reactors can be magnitudes of orders faster than in a batch reactor and this prevents the hot-spot generation that can stimulate side reactions or runaway reactions to occur.

During 2016 three professors left the\ndepartment (Lazlo Bruszt, Alex Trechsel and Pepper\nCulpepper) and one chair was still vacant from\nprevious years. These vacancies follow the natural\npace of replacement of the faculty, due to the temporary\nnature of contracts at the EUI. Dorothee Bohle\n(former professor of political science at the Central\nEuropean University, Budapest), joined the SPS Department\nin September 2016 and replaced Professor\nBruszt. She holds a Chair in Political Science and her\nresearch focusses on comparative political economy\nwith a special emphasis on East Central Europe. The\nhiring of Bohle guarantees research and supervision\ncontinuity in the study of political economy and policy\nresponses in the aftermath of the great recession,\nparticularly in Eastern Europe. In 2016, the hiring\nof Anton Hemerijck (professor at the Vrije Universiteit,\nAmsterdam) and Ellen Immergut (professor\nof comparative politics at Humboldt University, Berlin)\nhas also been completed.

The three contributions in this legal working paper discuss various aspects of such climate change litigation around the world. The papers examine the evolution of climate-related cases, the scope of such cases and the varying grounds on which they have been based. They also focus in some detail on certain key judgments addressing novel issues, as well as a recent climate-related case brought against a national central bank. The papers were originally presented at the Legal Colloquium on \u201cClimate change litigation and central banks &#8211; Action for the environment\u201d, organised by the European Central Bank on 27 May 2021.", "published_on": "2021-11-25", "added_on": "2021-11-29", "document_url": "https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/2bf49858-4e6b-11ec-91ac-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=2bf49858-4e6b-11ec-91ac-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/afcb43da520fb106ce5fc5fbe538e1cc.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/afcb43da520fb106ce5fc5fbe538e1cc.png", "topics": ["Law", "Justice", "Government", "State of the Netherlands v.

A particular\nthank you is owed to Tine Gade who, as the Academic Council (AC)\nrepresentative of the postdoctoral Fellows and the Fellows\u2019 representative\non the Steering Committee (SC), helped considerably in involving other\nFellows in the self-assessment process and in putting forward their\nviews at meetings with the Research Council as well as the AC and SC.\nThree important changes have been or will soon be introduced as a\nresult. First, we have arranged for Fellows to have the same reduction\nas researchers for meals at the EUI. Already, this has led more Fellows\nto use these facilities regularly, aiding intellectual community building\namong them and with the EUI as a whole which is such a core aspect\nof the Programme. Second, as of next year we shall be introducing a\nmaternity leave policy \u2013 part of our on-going efforts to make the MWP\nmore family friendly and to promote gender equality. We see this as a\nkey part of our ethos in supporting early career researchers. Third, we\nhave decided to experiment with increasing the second year stipend for\nECO Fellows who do teaching and mentoring within the department.\nAgain, we see this as a way whereby Fellows can play an important\nrole as junior faculty within the EUI, offering an important resource to\ndepartments and researchers while gaining experience and enhanced\nmentoring themselves. We also had a long deliberation over whether to\nextend the Fellowship to two years for all Fellows. Here, the conclusion\nwas that there are really two reasonable views. On the one hand, Fellows\nby and large do as well on the job market after one year as after two, so\nthat keeping the Fellowship to one year increases access to this resource\nto more people.

Significant amounts of water are used for extracting and transforming energy; and energy is used for collecting, pumping, treating and desalinising water. This interdependence implies that the management of energy and water should be addressed simultaneously, in order to increase energy efficiency in the water sector and reduce the water footprint of the energy industries. The JRC WEFE Nexus project (Water-Energy-Food- Ecosystems Nexus: Analysing solutions for securing supply), which began in January 2018, aims to improve the resilience of water-using sectors, allowing the JRC to leverage its capacity to integrate various policy aspects (agriculture, energy and environment) while addressing the specific needs of policy DGs. In May 2018, the IEA\u2019s Experts\u2019 Group workshop on R&D Priority-Setting and Evaluation explored opportunities to address the R&D planning and policies related to the energy-water nexus in a more effective way. The workshop\u2019s report identifies nexus-related challenges and opportunities and offers perspectives and best practices. During the same month, the second Sentinel- satellite (part of the European Union\u2019s Copernicus programme) delivered its first data set. The satellite provides information about oceans and inland waters (areas, temperatures, quality and depth), vegetation, land use and many other aspects to the Copernicus Global Land service. Back in 2016, the JRC and the United States Department of Energy (DoE) jointly organised the workshop Understanding the Water-Energy Nexus: Integrated Water and Power System Modelling, where experts compared and exchanged state-of-the-art modelling methodologies and best practices, discussing problems and solutions. In December 2018, the DoE will organize a follow-up event, the 2nd High-Level Workshop on Understanding the Water-Energy Nexus: Integrated Water and Power System Modelling. In this occasion, experts will discuss the results of the Integrated Water and Power System Modelling Challenge, in which different teams are modelling and analysing scenarios related to energy and water systems.", "published_on": "2018-11-07", "added_on": "2019-07-23", "document_url": "https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/57b08669-e308-11e8-b690-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://publications.europa.eu/portal2012-portlet/html/downloadHandler.jsp?identifier=57b08669-e308-11e8-b690-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/b01970d31073ec5237fef7e750d58b32.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/b01970d31073ec5237fef7e750d58b32.png", "topics": ["Water", "Desalination", "Sustainability", "Solar power", "European Union", "Renewable energy", "Water resources", "Water-energy nexus", "Energy development", "Energy policy of the European Union", "Water scarcity", "Biofuel", "Agriculture", "Sustainable Development Goals", "Low-carbon economy", "Power station", "Water footprint", "Electricity generation", "Biomass", "Fuel", "International Energy Agency", "Energy poverty", "Human activities", "Energy", "Natural resources", "Natural environment", "Nature", "Wind power", "Climate change mitigation", "Hydroelectricity", "Reverse osmosis", "Sustainable development", "Fossil fuel", "Water, energy and food security nexus", "Energy industry", "Sustainable energy", "Artificial objects", "Natural gas", "Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development", "Environmental technology", "Greenhouse gas", "Photovoltaics", "Efficient energy use", "Climate change adaptation", "Energiewende in Germany", "Petroleum", "Irrigation", "Thermal power station", "Sanitation", "Carbon capture and storage", "Innovation", "Solar desalination"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["environment", "environment>natural resources", "weather", "environment>natural resources>water", "science and technology", "science and technology>social sciences"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": [], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1016/j.scs.2017.02.007", "title": "Connecting the resource nexus to basic urban service provision \u2013 with a focus on water-energy interactions in New York City", "journal": "Sustainable Cities and Society", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.3390/w8020059", "title": "A Methodology to Assess the Water Energy Food Ecosystems Nexus in Transboundary River Basins", "journal": "Water", "publisher": "MDPI AG"}, {"doi": "10.2760/739963", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1596/978-1-4648-0466-3", "title": "Enhancing the Climate Resilience of Africa's Infrastructure: The Power and Water Sectors", "publisher": "The World Bank"}, {"doi": "10.1038/nclimate1789", "title": "Integrated analysis of climate change, land-use, energy and water strategies", "journal": "Nature Climate Change", "publisher": "Springer Nature"}, {"doi": "10.1038/nclimate1546", "title": "Vulnerability of US and European electricity supply to climate change", "journal": "Nature Climate Change", "publisher": "Springer Nature"}], "policy": [{"overton_id": "clubofrome-a781d4ea0dfd6d935c935d3f25f34736", "title": "The Limits to Growth", "policy_source_id": "clubofrome"}, {"overton_id": "jointresearcheu-83bd73d1546c47c32166da4d6b420d1b", "title": "The water-power nexus of the Iberian Peninsula power system: WATERFLEX project", "policy_source_id": "jointresearcheu"}, {"overton_id": "worldbank-349c0d8330a972fffc4ccc9b369fe18a", "title": "Enhancing the Climate Resilience of Africa's Infrastructure : The Power and Water Sectors", "policy_source_id": "worldbank"}], "news": [], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "rightsand democracy, climatechange.

Within the specific context of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), it is argued that the EU and the European Member States are \u201cregulatory states\u201d that have evolved in response to the demands of economic modernization. A very distinctive feature of the regulatory state in the EU, however, is that the general trend of deregulation over time \u2013 assuming that \u201cmarkets\u201d work effectively \u2013 coincides with the political will of greater European integration.

This study shows that creating the institutional framework for implementation is a challenging and drawn-out process. While all countries have made some progress with devising these mechanisms, they are short of the necessary political leadership, policy planning, administrative capacity and there is a dearth of budgetary planning to enable effective implementation.

Its most pertinent feature is that its core principles are codified in a referable system, which serves as the primary source of law. The Constitution of the Republic of Iceland No. 33/1944 is the highest source of law, followed by statutory legislation and regulatory statutes. The judicial system in Iceland is based on the Constitution. The new Judiciary Act No. 50/2016 of 7 June 2016, replacing Judiciary Act No. 15/1998, has more specific provisions on the structure of the courts. A new court level was introduced in Iceland on 1 January 2018 with the new Act on the Judiciary, replacing the former two tiers with a three-tier system.

We show that it is always a political equilibrium to implement CU. Crucially, while CUs may\nbe formed because of lobbying, we show that they improve the welfare of member countries as long as trade\nwith the rest of the world remains positive. In line with these results, we show empirically that CUs are much\nmore important to world trade in terms trade volume and membership scope than so far acknowledged in\nthe literature. Surprisingly little is known empirically about the effect of Customs Unions on tariff policy.\nIn my second chapter, Determining the Common External Tariff in a Customs Union: Evidence from the\nEurasian Customs Union, I seek to fill the void. Using a large panel data set from the Eurasian Customs\nUnion (ECU), established from 2010 between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, I demonstrate the importance\nof mutual protectionism: member states user their bargaining power to spill over to CU partners high tariffs\nfor those goods which were previously strongly protected nationally. There is little evidence of the reverse\n3 4 CONTENTS effect, i.e. tariffs being negotiated down for lines that were previously handled liberally\nin national tariff policy. This effect is demonstrated using three methodologies: analysis of variance using\nunique explanatory power of each variable, determining Shapley value from analysis of variance and OLS\nregression. The chapter also develops a simple model to rationalise the effect. Trade facilitation, the reduction\nof administrative and other barriers barriers, has become a key policy priority. Customs Unions may eliminate\ninternal border controls. But how strongly can such measures bene t trade? In the ECU, the elimination of\nborders proceeded in two stages, which allows me to study the Trade Impact of Non Tariff Trade Costs in\nchapter 3. I control for tariff changes and other factors to show that the growth in internal trade between\nthe ECU member countries can be attributed to reduced trade costs, rather than trade diversion due to\ntariff increases. The natural experiment of border removal thus allows more precise estimates of trade costs\nthan approaches that capture non tariff costs merely as a residual. Finally, The Layers of the Information\nTechnology Agreement Impact joint work with Christian Henn turns to plurilateral agreements. We show\nhow the WTO\u2019s Information Technology Agreement (ITA) affected trade flows and value chain participation\nin the IT sector. We show that this agreement did not only lead to increased imports, but by reducing the cost\nof intermediate goods ITA members were also able to increase their exports of final goods. Our estimation\nstrategy is based on the plausibly exogenous entry of late signatories to the agreement, who ratified the ITA\nas part of a broader policy objective. Using product level data, we are able to take into account the various\nlayers of ITA impact, dissecting the impact of tariff reduction, tariff elimination to zero, and over and above\ntariff reductions, including through firm relocation via intermediate goods channel. We find that having\nzero tariffs is associated with more imports of intermediate than final goods, and with participation in global\nvalue chains. This finding also supports the line of thought that trade policy certainty attracts investment.\nDefence date: 6 October 2014.

The set of causal factors identified by this\ntheory provides a basis for identifying pathways to high and low office attainment outcomes that are that\nare empirically consistent and theoretically coherent. In studying office retention outcomes, it develops a\nframework based on parties\u2019 incentives to maximise their electoral and governmental outcomes within a\ndynamic and institutionally variable setting.

Instead, the country\u2019s regional inequalities grew large as a result\nof different endowments of human capital. In turn, human capital differences inherited from pre-unification\nstates remained large as a result of public policy, which established a decentralized education system in\n1859. This choice delayed convergence in primary schooling across regions, because of the tight connection\nbetween municipal fiscal capacity and the supply of schools and teachers. Centralized education, introduced\nwith the Daneo-Credaro Reform in 1911, loosened this link and favoured regional convergence in human\ncapital. Contrary to expectations, local institutional mechanisms did not play a large role in the growth of\nmass education: a detailed analysis of the determinants of primary schooling across Italy\u2019s provinces in the\nyears 1871\u20121911 confirms that local economic conditions influenced the development of human capital far\nmore than political participation and access to local decision-making.

The interplay between different types of agents is at the center of my research, both when\nit comes to matching between agents and sorting from agents to sectors. The first chapter focuses on the\nrole of financial development for structural change. When credit constrained, more talented agents sort into\nmore labor-intensive sectors than less talented agents. When borrowing becomes more available, talented\nagents sort into capital-intensive sectors to optimally leverage their talent. Consequently, the capital rental\nrates rise and less talented agents sort into labor-intensive sectors. Thus, financial development reverses the\nsorting pattern. Furthermore, simulation results indicate that employment shares increase in relatively laborintensive\nsectors. I show that the empirical data is consistent with these theoretical findings. In the second\nchapter, I analyze the consequences of cooperation on inequality. I develop a heterogeneous agents model\nof cooperation distinguishing between two types of cooperation, between-task and within-task cooperation.\nThe former is the opportunity to assign different tasks to different agents. The latter is the reassignment of\ntasks from one agent to another in cases where the first agent fails. Cooperation increases inequality at the\ntop and decreases inequality at the bottom.

However, little is known about how its\nrepresentatives\u2014Members\u2019 of the European Parliament (MEP)\u2014connect, service and cultivate relations\nwith their constituencies between two elections points.

Using\noriginal data from the author\u2019s self-administered 2009 MEP survey (N=145), this thesis empirically traces\nMEP\u2019s constituency orientations in three steps.

Could it be that\nthe various interactive, transactional and asynchronous features that the Internet provides prompt MEP to\nuse their websites, blogs or social networking sites as quasi virtual constituency offices? In view that a fair\ndegree of variation was found in MEP\u2019s constituency outreach, the third last step looks at the determinant\nof this variation. Overall, the thesis\u2019 findings demonstrate that in spite the low institutional and electoral\nincentives for them to engage in constituency work, MEP conduct a wide range of constituency outreach\nactivities both offline and online. Moreover, citizens contact MEP with diverse types of casework. At the same\ntime data also showed that majority of MEP still prioritize and attach more importance to their legislative\nduties as oppose to their constituency work. With respect to MEP\u2019s Internet usage, the thesis findings further\nsuggest that it is yet premature to conclude that the \u2018virtual constituency office\u2019 is replacing the conventional\nconstituency (offline).\nDefence date: 25 March 2014.

The first chapter of this thesis is joint work with L. D\u2019Aurizio and L.\nRomano. It documents the credit allocation by Italian banks following the failure of Lehman Brothers. The\nempirical analysis reveals that Italian family firms experienced a significantly smaller contraction in granted\nloans than non-family firms. It is showed that the difference in the amount of credit granted to family and\nnon-family firms is related to an increased role for soft information in Italian banks\u2019 operations. The second\nchapter, joint work with D. Menno, quantifies the welfare effects of the drop in aggregate house prices for\nleveraged and un-leveraged households in the Great Recession. It features a dynamic general equilibrium\nmodel calibrated to the U.S. economy and simulates the 2007\u20122009 Great Recession as a contemporaneous\nshock to the financial intermediation sector and aggregate income. The estimates show that borrowers lost\nsignificantly more in terms of welfare than savers. In counter-factual experiments it has showed that this\nloss is larger the higher the households\u2019 leverage.

Why, in other words, do policy makers in some\ncountries innovate faster than in others? This thesis challenges conventional explanations, according to\nwhich policy change occurs in response to class conflict, partisan preferences, power of professional groups,\nor institutional and policy legacies. The thesis instead argues that different paths of policy change can be best\nexplained by the different learning processes by which policy makers develop ideas for new policies in reaction\nto old policies. The thesis draws upon both ideational and institutional streams of literature on policy change,\nand develops its argument that policy change, understood as a learning process, is a result of interactions\nbetween three different, yet interdependent factors\u2014ideas, interests and institutions. The thesis explores\nthis argument by investigating in detail two radical cases of policy innovation\u2014the introduction of marketoriented\nelements in Czech and Polish healthcare policy during the first two post-communist decades. The\nselection of the two cases is based on the methodological rationale of the \u2018most similar system design\u2019, given\nthat the healthcare systems of the two countries were both state-dominated under communism, while in\nthe post-communist period the governments of the two countries introduced market-oriented reforms that\nfollowed rather divergent policy paths.

The thesis looks at these two cases of\nhealthcare reforms from a long-term historical perspective, covering the inter-war, the communist and,\nmost thoroughly, the post-communist period. It draws upon the official documents, secondary literature\nand more than 40 interviews with policy making elites, and compares the two policy paths using small-N\nresearch design, causal analysis and process tracing techniques. The main finding of the thesis is that the\nmarket-oriented ideas that occurred in healthcare policy circles during the 1970s and 1980s were crucial\ndrivers of the post-communist reforms in the two countries. However, the capacity of these ideas to serve as\na basis of policy change was dependent on two factors\u2014on the existence of political actors who were willing\nto promote these ideas, and on the interaction of institutional veto points with the electoral and partisan\ndynamic.

This complexity challenges the identification of the law\napplicable\u2014international humanitarian law or/and international human rights law\u2014 and, thus, challenges\nthe enforcement of any adequate regulation for PMSCs. Three case studies\u2014Colombia, Mexico, and Haiti\u2014\nillustrate these issues. In Colombia, a noninternational armed conflict has been ongoing for approximately\nfifty years alongside criminal activities linked to drug trafficking.

In addition to the industrialisation thesis and the role of income\ninequality, I study the implications of political democracy and economic liberalisation for intergenerational\nstatus reproduction. Individual-level consequences of mobility are explored using the socialpsychological\nconcept of the self-serving bias in causal attribution, which implies that people are more likely to explain\nindividual success as resulting from their own abilities and efforts.

Even though the use of PMSCs is not per se\nproblematic, the lack of an efficient international and national regulatory framework for PMSCs raises\nseveral concerns about the protection of human rights. This study aims first to analyze PMSCs\u2019 activities and\nregulation thereof in conditions in which there is a mix of several types of situation, such as armed conflict and\ncriminal activities or post-disaster and post-conflict. This complexity challenges the identification of the law\napplicable\u2014international humanitarian law or/and international human rights law\u2014 and, thus, challenges\nthe enforcement of any adequate regulation for PMSCs. Three case studies\u2014Colombia, Mexico, and Haiti\u2014\nillustrate these issues. In Colombia, a noninternational armed conflict has been ongoing for approximately\nfifty years alongside criminal activities linked to drug trafficking. In Mexico, the War on Drugs has escalated to\na situation technically classifiable as an armed conflict. Finally, in Haiti, the situation evolved from an armed\nconflict (2004\u20122007), to a situation of peace with a high criminal rate before the earthquake (2007\u20122010),\nto a post-earthquake disaster situation in which criminality is rising but the intensity of the violence has\nnot reached the level to be classified an armed conflict (2010\u2012present). In order to implement international\nstandards concerning PMSC regulation it is necessary to consider both bodies of law and force territorial\nstates to assume their responsibilities. Considering these elements I then argue that the Inter-American\nSystem of Human Rights can play a significant role in improving PMSCs\u2019 regulation in Latin America and\nthe Caribbean thanks to is avant-gardiste features.

The interplay between different types of agents is at the center of my research, both when\nit comes to matching between agents and sorting from agents to sectors. The first chapter focuses on the\nrole of financial development for structural change. When credit constrained, more talented agents sort into\nmore labor-intensive sectors than less talented agents. When borrowing becomes more available, talented\nagents sort into capital-intensive sectors to optimally leverage their talent. Consequently, the capital rental\nrates rise and less talented agents sort into labor-intensive sectors. Thus, financial development reverses the\nsorting pattern. Furthermore, simulation results indicate that employment shares increase in relatively laborintensive\nsectors. I show that the empirical data is consistent with these theoretical findings. In the second\nchapter, I analyze the consequences of cooperation on inequality. I develop a heterogeneous agents model\nof cooperation distinguishing between two types of cooperation, between-task and within-task cooperation.\nThe former is the opportunity to assign different tasks to different agents. The latter is the reassignment of\ntasks from one agent to another in cases where the first agent fails. Cooperation increases inequality at the\ntop and decreases inequality at the bottom.

In a general equilibrium framework, the government chooses a level of enforcement and a bundle\nof benefits maximizing the workers utility subject to a budget constraint. A representative firm chooses the\nshare of workers in formality and informality that they want to hire, and the workers offer a share of time\nin formality and informality. The chapter concludes that differences in the quality functions of government\nenforcement and benefits are found, as well as in the fines established to enforce the agents. The second\nchapter, co-authored with Gonzalo Salas, examines how the level of enforcement of the conditionalities of\ntwo Conditional Cash Transfer programs affects the ratios of high school students drop-out. We develop a\nstructural discrete choice model in which the individuals who are above or below the participation threshold\ndecide whether or not to attend school, participate in the labor market, or spend time on home production\nand/or leisure. The policy experiments show that if the level of enforcement is higher, individuals change\nstudy for leisure and work, but this last choice has a limit. Moreover, if the amount of transfer is reduced, the\nshare of those who only study goes down and individuals work more.

The estimates\nsuggest that taxes levied on food items are completely shifted to consumer prices, whereas the pricing of other\ngoods is not materially affected.

Consistent with the estimated changes in labor productivity, wage regressions show\nthe expansion of broadband internet improves (worsens) the labor outcomes of skilled (unskilled) workers.\nWe explore several possible explanations for the skill bias of broadband internet.

The first chapter of this thesis investigates the\nrole of new firms (\u2018start-ups\u2019) in the US labor market. Start-ups and young firms grow faster and create more\nnet jobs than older, incumbent firms. Yet since 2007 the number of start-ups in the US has declined by over\n20%, accounting for a large part of the persistently high unemployment rate. I claim that this fact is related\nto the unprecedented fall in the value of real estate. Based on the empirical evidence I construct a model\nthat captures the idea that start-ups require external financing, for which real estate is used as collateral.\nI calibrate and compute a quantitative competitive industry model with endogenous entry and exit, firm\nheterogeneity, labor adjustment costs, and aggregate shocks. It generates a \u2018jobless recovery\u2019 similar to what\nwe observed in the US in the aftermath of the 2007\u201209 recession and is able to explain over 80% of the\nincrease and persistence in unemployment since the recession. The second chapter, joint work with Russell\nCooper, studies the productivity implications of frictions in the reallocation of factors. Recent empirical\nwork has shown that misallocation of factors can have sizeable effects on the levels of aggregate output and\nproductivity. We are interested in the question whether these frictions can also produce important cyclical\nmovements. We find that the effects are quantitatively important in the presence of fluctuations in adjustment\nfrictions and/or the cross sectional variation of profitability shocks. These fluctuations depend on higher\norder moments of the joint distribution of capital and plant-level productivity rather than mean values alone.\nEven without aggregate productivity shocks, the model has quantitative properties that resemble those of a\nstandard stochastic growth model and match important facts about the cyclicality of reallocation and firm\nproductivity dispersion.

In line with these results, we show empirically that CUs are much\nmore important to world trade in terms trade volume and membership scope than so far acknowledged in\nthe literature. Surprisingly little is known empirically about the effect of Customs Unions on tariff policy.\nIn my second chapter, Determining the Common External Tariff in a Customs Union: Evidence from the\nEurasian Customs Union, I seek to fill the void. Using a large panel data set from the Eurasian Customs\nUnion (ECU), established from 2010 between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, I demonstrate the importance\nof mutual protectionism: member states user their bargaining power to spill over to CU partners high tariffs\nfor those goods which were previously strongly protected nationally. There is little evidence of the reverse\n3 4 CONTENTS effect, i.e. tariffs being negotiated down for lines that were previously handled liberally\nin national tariff policy. This effect is demonstrated using three methodologies: analysis of variance using\nunique explanatory power of each variable, determining Shapley value from analysis of variance and OLS\nregression. The chapter also develops a simple model to rationalise the effect. Trade facilitation, the reduction\nof administrative and other barriers barriers, has become a key policy priority. Customs Unions may eliminate\ninternal border controls. But how strongly can such measures bene t trade? In the ECU, the elimination of\nborders proceeded in two stages, which allows me to study the Trade Impact of Non Tariff Trade Costs in\nchapter 3. I control for tariff changes and other factors to show that the growth in internal trade between\nthe ECU member countries can be attributed to reduced trade costs, rather than trade diversion due to\ntariff increases. The natural experiment of border removal thus allows more precise estimates of trade costs\nthan approaches that capture non tariff costs merely as a residual. Finally, The Layers of the Information\nTechnology Agreement Impact joint work with Christian Henn turns to plurilateral agreements. We show\nhow the WTO\u2019s Information Technology Agreement (ITA) affected trade flows and value chain participation\nin the IT sector. We show that this agreement did not only lead to increased imports, but by reducing the cost\nof intermediate goods ITA members were also able to increase their exports of final goods. Our estimation\nstrategy is based on the plausibly exogenous entry of late signatories to the agreement, who ratified the ITA\nas part of a broader policy objective. Using product level data, we are able to take into account the various\nlayers of ITA impact, dissecting the impact of tariff reduction, tariff elimination to zero, and over and above\ntariff reductions, including through firm relocation via intermediate goods channel.

In my work I focus on firm heterogeneity. I investigate the US\nlabor market implications of a drop in the number of new firms, study the cyclical effects on productivity due\nto limits in the reallocation of capital across firms, and quantify the effectiveness of a policy which attempted\nto save jobs in Germany by altering firm incentives for lay-offs. The first chapter of this thesis investigates the\nrole of new firms (\u2018start-ups\u2019) in the US labor market. Start-ups and young firms grow faster and create more\nnet jobs than older, incumbent firms. Yet since 2007 the number of start-ups in the US has declined by over\n20%, accounting for a large part of the persistently high unemployment rate. I claim that this fact is related\nto the unprecedented fall in the value of real estate. Based on the empirical evidence I construct a model\nthat captures the idea that start-ups require external financing, for which real estate is used as collateral.\nI calibrate and compute a quantitative competitive industry model with endogenous entry and exit, firm\nheterogeneity, labor adjustment costs, and aggregate shocks. It generates a \u2018jobless recovery\u2019 similar to what\nwe observed in the US in the aftermath of the 2007\u201209 recession and is able to explain over 80% of the\nincrease and persistence in unemployment since the recession. The second chapter, joint work with Russell\nCooper, studies the productivity implications of frictions in the reallocation of factors. Recent empirical\nwork has shown that misallocation of factors can have sizeable effects on the levels of aggregate output and\nproductivity. We are interested in the question whether these frictions can also produce important cyclical\nmovements. We find that the effects are quantitatively important in the presence of fluctuations in adjustment\nfrictions and/or the cross sectional variation of profitability shocks. These fluctuations depend on higher\norder moments of the joint distribution of capital and plant-level productivity rather than mean values alone.\nEven without aggregate productivity shocks, the model has quantitative properties that resemble those of a\nstandard stochastic growth model and match important facts about the cyclicality of reallocation and firm\nproductivity dispersion. The last chapter, joint work with Russell Cooper and Moritz Meyer, studies the\nemployment and productivity implications of short-time work (\u2018Kurzarbeit\u2019) in Germany. During the years\n2009\u201210 this policy was intended to provide incentives for firms to adjust labor input by reducing hours\nper worker instead of firing workers. Using confidential German firm micro data we estimate a model of\ncostly labor adjustment. We use the estimated model to simulate the effects of the policy during the recent\nrecession, trying to quantify in how far the German short-time work scheme reduced the allocative efficiency\nof the German labor market.\nDefence date: 18 June 2014.

In light of this initial analysis,\nfrom which the significance of the national foundations of private law also comes to the fore, the European\nspace is advanced as one of commonality and diversity of legal cultures and traditions. Recognising the\nunlikelihood of the codification of private law, the thesis makes a plea for the recognition of a shift in\nthe perspective of legal development, to one which acknowledges the dynamic nature of private law as it\nemerges within a pluralist, multi-level construct of regulation. Against this background and in light of the\ncontextual perspective to which it gives rise, the thesis argues that comparative analysis might facilitate the\ndevelopment of such a perspective, particularly in light of the role of the courts, both national and European.\nNotwithstanding this potential, a critical assessment of contemporary comparative law reveals its theoretical\nand methodological poverty and illustrates the need for a developed understanding of \u2018complex\u2019 comparison,\nengaging this aforementioned shift in perspective.

To\naccomplish these goals, the thesis adopts a multidisciplinary approach of a newly emerging \u2018international\nrelations and international law\u2019 sub-discipline. Firstly, by relying on rational choice, historical institutionalism\nand game theory, it examines how different countries have been responding to the continuously evolving\ndata privacy policy challenges, and how these divergent responses created a cooperative stalemate among\nthe leading regulatory states. Secondly, it scrutinizes different approaches to customary international law to\nexplore whether data privacy could be considered a principle of customary international law, which would\nmake the mass-surveillance programmes illegal irrespective of the (non)existence of a binding international\ndata privacy treaty. Then, by relying on international agreement design literature, the thesis explores the\ndifferent \u2018hard law dreams\u2019 for data privacy and argues that these options are difficult to realize in practice.\nAs an alternative, it adopts a global legal pluralism lens to examine the promise of mutual recognition\narrangements; and applies trans-governmental networks theory to see whether data privacy commissioners\ncould improve international cooperation.

Between\n1953 and 1963, Africa\u2019s position in the international system was not primarily determined by the struggle\nbetween the USSR and the US. African leaders did not simply play off the Cold war superpowers against\neach other to extract gains. Kwame Nkrumah, the leader of Ghana, projected his own pan-African ideology\nto other parts of the continent. What was at stake in this scramble were the so-called \u2018minds\u2019 of African\npeoples. Nkrumah blamed colonialism for instilling non-white populations with an inferiority complex,\nwhile policy makers in the West drew on the insights of ethno-psychology to argue that underdevelopment\nwas a psychological problem. To develop men into the modern mindset or, conversely, to create an \u2018African\nPersonality\u2019, policymakers relied on education and information media. When other African statesmen\nwere unwilling to support Ghana\u2019s pan-African vision, Nkrumah\u2019s public discourse became more stridently\nanticolonial, in an attempt to mobilise the African general public. With the atrocities of the Congo crisis in\nmind, President John F.

Those shifting views on African development profoundly influenced the way in which the Bandung\nConference, the Suez Crisis, the independence of Ghana, the Sahara atomic bomb tests and the Congo crisis\nwere understood. As a whole, this analysis presents a sharp departure from a narrative in which non-Western\nactors are depicted as subaltern agents who can only resist or utilise Cold War pressures.

In the first part of the thesis, the alleged connection between institutional\nconstraints governments face in their domestic arenas and their respective institutional preferences at Treaty\nnegotiations was tested.

Recent evidence has shown that parental job loss negatively influences the school\nperformance of their offspring. Chapter 2 uses an original dataset I collected myself (described in Chapter 1)\nto study the effect of parental job loss on children\u2019s school performance during the Great Recession in Spain.\nConditioning on student fixed effects and observed covariates, the Great Recession generates variation in job\nloss that could be considered analogous to that provided by randomisation. The results show that after father\u2019s\njob loss, students experience a negative and significant decrease on average grades of about 13 to 19% of a\nstandard deviation. This effect remains unaltered once the impact of mother\u2019s job loss on grades is accounted\nfor. Interestingly, maternal job loss has no significant effect on the school performance of her offspring.\nMoreover, school performance prior to father\u2019s job loss is not affected by future job losses, reinforcing the\ncausal interpretation of the link between father\u2019s job loss and children\u2019s educational outcomes. Finally,\nthe impact of paternal job loss is not homogeneous across students, but it is rather largely concentrated\namong children whose fathers suffer long unemployment spells after job loss and those students in already\ndisadvantaged families in terms of the level of education of the father. Therefore, these results are pointing out\na mechanism (paternal job loss) through which further inequalities might develop during and after a deep\neconomic crisis. Chapter 3 uses exogenous variation in regional labour market policies in Spain to identify the\nimpact of paternal job insecurity on the students\u2019 probability of graduating from compulsory education on\ntime. Using data from the Spanish Labour Force Survey, average marginal effects and local average treatment\neffects (LATE) are estimated. Results indicate that students whose fathers hold a permanent contract (as\nopposed to a temporary, fixed-term contract) the year they should graduate from compulsory education are,\non average, 7 percentage points more likely to graduate on time. LATE estimates are considerably higher,\nsuggesting that those students whose fathers obtained a permanent contract as a result of the availability of\nregional subsidies reaped bigger benefits from paternal job stability.

Secondly, on the theoretical level,\nit relies on a series of analytical constructs from legal and political theory to critically assess various aspects\nof cooperation and aims to contribute to the further advancement of those methodological frameworks. To\naccomplish these goals, the thesis adopts a multidisciplinary approach of a newly emerging \u2018international\nrelations and international law\u2019 sub-discipline. Firstly, by relying on rational choice, historical institutionalism\nand game theory, it examines how different countries have been responding to the continuously evolving\ndata privacy policy challenges, and how these divergent responses created a cooperative stalemate among\nthe leading regulatory states. Secondly, it scrutinizes different approaches to customary international law to\nexplore whether data privacy could be considered a principle of customary international law, which would\nmake the mass-surveillance programmes illegal irrespective of the (non)existence of a binding international\ndata privacy treaty. Then, by relying on international agreement design literature, the thesis explores the\ndifferent \u2018hard law dreams\u2019 for data privacy and argues that these options are difficult to realize in practice.\nAs an alternative, it adopts a global legal pluralism lens to examine the promise of mutual recognition\narrangements; and applies trans-governmental networks theory to see whether data privacy commissioners\ncould improve international cooperation.

Countries in Latin America with\ndifferent levels of informality were compared, highlighting the features that could induce these different\nlevels. In a general equilibrium framework, the government chooses a level of enforcement and a bundle\nof benefits maximizing the workers utility subject to a budget constraint. A representative firm chooses the\nshare of workers in formality and informality that they want to hire, and the workers offer a share of time\nin formality and informality. The chapter concludes that differences in the quality functions of government\nenforcement and benefits are found, as well as in the fines established to enforce the agents. The second\nchapter, co-authored with Gonzalo Salas, examines how the level of enforcement of the conditionalities of\ntwo Conditional Cash Transfer programs affects the ratios of high school students drop-out. We develop a\nstructural discrete choice model in which the individuals who are above or below the participation threshold\ndecide whether or not to attend school, participate in the labor market, or spend time on home production\nand/or leisure. The policy experiments show that if the level of enforcement is higher, individuals change\nstudy for leisure and work, but this last choice has a limit. Moreover, if the amount of transfer is reduced, the\nshare of those who only study goes down and individuals work more. The third chapter examines how changes\nin the social security scheme affect the participation path of workers between formality and informality.\nWorkers construct their decision paths in the labor market depending on the retirement program and their\nendowment of human capital. The strictness of the requirements lead to more formality but not enough to\nobtain a pension for all the educative levels.

We\nprovide conditions under which favouritism makes bidders more or less aggressive than in the benchmark\nmodel without corruption, and prove that bidders are always more aggressive when faced with a non\nfavouritist corrupt auctioneer. In both cases, the revenue maximizing auctioneer deprives his collaborator\nof all \u2018surplus\u2019 of corruption. Finally, we study the auctioneer\u2019s choice of corruption type, and find that his\nexpected revenue is not necessarily monotonic in the probability that he choses one type of corruption or the\nother. In the second chapter, entitled Bond Auctions and Financial Sector Liquidity Risk, a joint work with\nGr\u00e9gory Claeys, we aim to provide a tool for central banks\u2014and in particular for the Central Bank of Chile\u2014\nto measure liquidity risk in their financial sector using the bidding behaviour of banks in bond auctions.\nFirst, we build a model combining the auction literature and the financial economics literature to understand\nprecisely the effect of the liquidity risk affecting banks on their bidding strategies in those auctions. We\ndevelop a benchmark version of the model with no insurance against the liquidity shock, and another with\na lender of last resort to see how the behavior of the banks is affected by this policy. Based on the revelation\nprinciple characterizing auctions, and using a unique dataset collected at Central Bank of Chile containing\nall the details of its open market operation auctions (where it sells bonds to drain money from the banking\nsector) between 2002 and 2012, we estimate the distribution of the liquidity risk across Chilean banks and\nits changes over time. The evolution of the estimated distribution seems to capture well the main episodes\nof liquidity stress of the last decade in the Chilean banking sector.

In the third chapter, entitled Strategic\nComplementarities and Corruption, we study an environment where agents compete against each other for\nthe acquisition of a public good procurement project, assigned by the government and handled by a possibly\ncorrupt inspector.

To answer these questions this thesis examined institutional\npreferences and strategies of governments at Treaty negotiations and in the day-to-day policy-making process\nin the policy area of PJCCM. In the first part of the thesis, the alleged connection between institutional\nconstraints governments face in their domestic arenas and their respective institutional preferences at Treaty\nnegotiations was tested. In a second part, strategic interactions between governments in the EU Council\nand the European Commission with respect to institutional rules in the legislative process in PJCCM were\nexamined.

The driving factors behind these day-to-day strategic\ninteractions are the ambiguity of and interstitial changes to institutional rules. More specifically, this thesis\nshows how ambiguous rules over EU competences in PJCCM and changes to these rules via rulings of the\nCourt of Justice lead actors to deploy litigation strategies (Commission), as well as legislative pre-emption\nstrategies (Member States).

This thesis maps the growing attempts by various actors to\ndeploy market mechanisms for biodiversity conservation, and their contestations. The purpose is to provide\nboth an empirically informed analysis of the still somewhat enigmatic global governance space, and to\nexpose the significance of approaching transnational legal processes without inherited conceptual categories\nand premises. The thesis unfolds in three steps. It first situates the emergence of market mechanisms for\nbiodiversity conservation in the context of dominant epistemological positions and governance trends,\narguing that these legitimate the use of the market in law and policy. The second part follows the introduction\nof concrete cases of market mechanisms from the discourses within conservation institutions to their realworld\nfunctioning. Emphasis is placed specifically on considering the institutional and normative interplay\nbetween the international and the transnational spheres; the way in which the operation of the market\ncomplements or challenges legal norms; and the political and ethical disputes involved in the setting up of\nthe market mechanisms. The third part draws attention to the importance of framing these mechanisms.\nAnalysing the governance function of market mechanisms by deploying regulatory concepts focuses on their\neffectiveness, but obscures the claims about their contested nature. The \u2018regulatory\u2019 framing is contrasted\nwith the framing of the same processes as \u2018neoliberal conservation\u2019, as professed by human scientists. The\ntwo competing narratives point to the expectations of law in transnational processes as oscillating between\nan instrument serving a functionalist project and a placeholder for more radical demands for changed social\nrelations and socio-economic trajectories.

We show that it is always a political equilibrium to implement CU. Crucially, while CUs may\nbe formed because of lobbying, we show that they improve the welfare of member countries as long as trade\nwith the rest of the world remains positive. In line with these results, we show empirically that CUs are much\nmore important to world trade in terms trade volume and membership scope than so far acknowledged in\nthe literature. Surprisingly little is known empirically about the effect of Customs Unions on tariff policy.\nIn my second chapter, Determining the Common External Tariff in a Customs Union: Evidence from the\nEurasian Customs Union, I seek to fill the void. Using a large panel data set from the Eurasian Customs\nUnion (ECU), established from 2010 between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, I demonstrate the importance\nof mutual protectionism: member states user their bargaining power to spill over to CU partners high tariffs\nfor those goods which were previously strongly protected nationally. There is little evidence of the reverse\n3 4 CONTENTS effect, i.e. tariffs being negotiated down for lines that were previously handled liberally\nin national tariff policy. This effect is demonstrated using three methodologies: analysis of variance using\nunique explanatory power of each variable, determining Shapley value from analysis of variance and OLS\nregression. The chapter also develops a simple model to rationalise the effect. Trade facilitation, the reduction\nof administrative and other barriers barriers, has become a key policy priority. Customs Unions may eliminate\ninternal border controls. But how strongly can such measures bene t trade? In the ECU, the elimination of\nborders proceeded in two stages, which allows me to study the Trade Impact of Non Tariff Trade Costs in\nchapter 3. I control for tariff changes and other factors to show that the growth in internal trade between\nthe ECU member countries can be attributed to reduced trade costs, rather than trade diversion due to\ntariff increases. The natural experiment of border removal thus allows more precise estimates of trade costs\nthan approaches that capture non tariff costs merely as a residual. Finally, The Layers of the Information\nTechnology Agreement Impact joint work with Christian Henn turns to plurilateral agreements. We show\nhow the WTO\u2019s Information Technology Agreement (ITA) affected trade flows and value chain participation\nin the IT sector. We show that this agreement did not only lead to increased imports, but by reducing the cost\nof intermediate goods ITA members were also able to increase their exports of final goods. Our estimation\nstrategy is based on the plausibly exogenous entry of late signatories to the agreement, who ratified the ITA\nas part of a broader policy objective. Using product level data, we are able to take into account the various\nlayers of ITA impact, dissecting the impact of tariff reduction, tariff elimination to zero, and over and above\ntariff reductions, including through firm relocation via intermediate goods channel. We find that having\nzero tariffs is associated with more imports of intermediate than final goods, and with participation in global\nvalue chains. This finding also supports the line of thought that trade policy certainty attracts investment.\nDefence date: 6 October 2014.

The context of the\nstudy is a sharp change in the VAT policy on food items in Norway. I examine the direct impact of the policy\nchange on the consumer prices of food items as well as any cross-price effects on other goods. The estimates\nsuggest that taxes levied on food items are completely shifted to consumer prices, whereas the pricing of other\ngoods is not materially affected. To understand the distributional effects of the VAT reform, I use expenditure\ndata and estimate the compensating variation of the tax induced price changes. I find that lowering the VAT\non food attenuates inequality in consumer welfare. Chapter 2 and 3 investigates how technology adoption\nin firms affects productivity and labor market outcomes. In chapter 2 (joint work with A. Akerman and M.\nMogstad), the focus is on whether adoption of broadband internet in firms enhance labor productivity and\nincrease wages. We find that broadband adoption favors skilled labor by increasing its relative productivity.\nBy comparison, broadband internet is a substitute for workers without high school diploma, lowering their\nmarginal productivity. Consistent with the estimated changes in labor productivity, wage regressions show\nthe expansion of broadband internet improves (worsens) the labor outcomes of skilled (unskilled) workers.\nWe explore several possible explanations for the skill bias of broadband internet. We find suggestive evidence\nthat broadband internet complements skilled workers in executing nonroutine abstract tasks, and substitutes\nfor unskilled workers in performing routine tasks. In chapter 3, I move attention to why firms differ so\nmuch in their abilities to convert inputs into output. One possible explanation is that firms choose different\ntechnology, giving variation in output that cannot be explained based on observable inputs like standard\nlabor or capital measures. I find that broadband internet accounts for about 2 to 3 percent of the standard\ndeviation in TFP across firms. I decompose aggregate TFP in the economy into an unweighted average of\nfirm-level TFP and the covariance between market share and firm-level TFP. I find that the contribution of\nthe covariance term to aggregate TFP is reduced substantially when I account for the variation in output that\ncan be explained by broadband adoption in firms.

In turn, human capital differences inherited from pre-unification\nstates remained large as a result of public policy, which established a decentralized education system in\n1859. This choice delayed convergence in primary schooling across regions, because of the tight connection\nbetween municipal fiscal capacity and the supply of schools and teachers.

The two\ncases are not studied for their own sake, but as examples of complex ideological tensions caused by the\nexpansion of state and the transformation of bourgeois society. What brings their stories together is their\nhaving a common point of reference in the late Enlightenment/Romantic fantasy of \u2018nonmodernity\u2019 of which\nthe anarchic frontier horseman is just one symbol. The overarching question that I address is how several\ndifferent actors in their contingent environments employed these symbols to construct the male subject of\nmodern politics (modernity being understood here as a disciplinary myth and a claim-making concept, rather\nthan a tangible historical condition). I offer contextualized interpretations of several texts: verse journals\ndirected at uneducated subalterns of Buenos Aires at the beginning of 1830s; a historical novel by Nikolai\nGogol; a celebrated biographical essay by Domingo F. Sarmiento; pulp novels, secret reports, memoirs and\npropaganda dossiers of Micha\u0142 Czajkowski, a Polish-Lithuanian politician and military commander based\nin Istanbul; Polishand Ukrainian-language writings of several minor authors from Austrian Galicia. I show\nthat the Cossack/gaucho myths are just two examples of dream about the free life beyond the limitations\nimposed by the state and society. In fact, that dream was present in many other environments and took many\ndifferent guises, US cowboys being just one obvious, though chronologically later, example. Such longings\nwere inextricably linked to the global \u2018structured transformations\u2019 interpreted by the historical actors as\nthe rise of \u2018modernity,\u2019 though clearly the figure of anarchic frontier horseman was not the only conceptual\ntool used to cope with them. What made the Cossack/gaucho myths so successful was that they were a very\nspecific antithesis of \u2018modernity,\u2019 one that combined 1) the rejection of state and family; 2) the claim to be\ntruly native; 3) and the promise of liberating the repressed masculine instincts.\nDefence date: 21 March 2017, Examining Board: Lucy Riall, EUI (Supervisor); Pieter Judson, EUI; Nicola\nMiller, UCL; Larry Wolff, NYU\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/45869"}, {"person": "Geoffrey Evans", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "snippet": "This thesis presents four essays that aim to explain within-individual variation in voter turnout. The\nmotivation behind this thesis is not only the importance of voter turnout to democracy, both in theoretical\nand substantive terms, but also the methodological and theoretical weaknesses in the existing literature\ncaused by the lack of attention given to why individuals vote at some points in their lives and not at others.\nThis deficit stands in contrast to the vast literature explaining aggregate level turnout \u2013 both within and\nbetween countries\u2013 and individual level turnout solely between individuals. Each of the four essays seeks to\nrethink one of the explanatory models of individual level voter turnout \u2013 mobilisation, resources, psychology\nand socialisation by applying many of their determinants to within-individual variation, as well as, in some\ncases, adding new ones. The methodological approach to explaining within-individual variation is to use\nfixed effects panel data models, as well as intermittently random effects models, cross-sectional models\nand structural equations. The data for these models comes from the British Household Panel Survey, the\nSwiss Household Panel Survey and the British Election Study. This thesis makes a number of theoretical,\nmethodological and substantive contributions. I show that within-individual variation in voting seems to\nbe fairly unaffected by such issues as material resources, \u2018antipolitical\u2019 sentiments, household politicisation\nor even feelings of personal ability to vote effectively \u2013 all of which have been mainstays of the between\nindividual literature. Rather, I conclude that individuals vote when they are interested in the politics of the\ntime, feel affinity towards a party or when a party has bothered to contact them, on the one hand, and, more\nfundamentally, by the lifestyle of the individual at the time of the election \u2013 with lifestyles built on rootedness,\nsocial integration and roles demanding responsibility increasing the individual\u2019s desire to turnout to vote.\nDefence date: 7 July 2017, Examining Board: Professor Hanspeter Kriesi, EUI; Professor Harold Clarke,\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas; Professor Geoffrey Evans, Nuffield College, University of Oxford; Professor\nDiego Gambetta, EUI\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/47184"}, {"person": "Eloise Scotford", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "snippet": "Roger BROWNSWORD, Eloise SCOTFORD and\nKaren YEUNG (eds), The Oxford handbook on the\nlaw and regulation of technology, Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2017 OnlineFirst\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/46167"}, {"person": "James Pattison", "affiliation": "University of Manchester", "snippet": "This develops a defence of the principle of the moral equality of combatants against recent revisionist critiques.\nIt does this by developing an interpretive and hermeneutical approach to the study of war and the just war\ntradition. This approach allows the meanings of war and of actions within war to be explored and it is on the\nbasis of this understanding of meaning that the moral equality of combatants is defended. It shows that these\nmeanings and distinctions cannot be recognized by the revisionists and that this is a moral and interpretive loss.\nThe thesis develops the argument of Michael Walzer\u2019s Spheres of Justice and applies it to war; it demonstrates\nthat war has a distinct meaning and that the principles for distributing identities, rights, and responsibilities\nin war are relative to this meaning. The thesis begins by exploring the history of the just war tradition and the\nevolution of the concept of combatancy and the distinction between combatants and non-combatants in order\nto demonstrate how the just war tradition constitutes war as an institution. It then explores the contemporary\ndebate and argues that whilst the traditional defences of the principle of the moral equality of combatants have\nbeen found wanting, the conclusions of the revisionists need not be accepted.

The thesis employs\nan empirical approach and uses quantitative methods. The German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and\nits sub-sample from the Youth Questionnaire are used to conduct the analyses. To capture personality,\nthe Big Five and Locus of Control are applied. The educational outcomes investigated are maths grades\nand school placement for 17-year-old, as well as years of education and income for adults. The study uses\ndata on education, socio-economic background, and personality measures spanning two generations: the\nparents and the children. With respect to the first research question, results indicate positive effects of\nOpenness to Experience, Conscientiousness and Locus of Control, and a negative effect of Neuroticism on\nschool placement. Effects of personality on grades were found to a lesser degree. In auto-regressive crosslagged\nmodels, personality and income have reciprocal effects over a time span of 10 years, where different\npersonality traits show different patterns over time.

The question of pro-competition bias is explored\nthrough an analysis of novel issues recently considered by antitrust authorities.

While observing that antitrust cases picked up by the Commission might serve as a\nsignalling device for the patent system intended to prompt an alternative solution to the problem at hand,\nways of developing further a communication by signalling outside the realm of enforcement are explored in\nan attempt to combat the risk of biases and to ensure an effective division of tasks.

I assess how\nfour political parties framed the protests, whether the latter were accompanied by changes in the parties\u2019\nplatforms and priorities, and whether politicians in office adjusted practical policies to accommodate protest\ndemands. In this research I draw on original data of parliamentary interventions, budget allocations, semistructured\ninterviews, and secondary sources, to answer these questions. The Gezi protests received a great\ndeal of attention from politicians, especially from the two opposition parties closest to the protests, the CHP\nand the BDP. However, both parties responded to the demands that aligned best with their pre-existing\nagendas, and with different loci of attention. The protests were also met with practical concessions on a few\nspecific demands. Yet these policy responses were narrowly targeted at the object and symbol of the initial\nprotests rather than at their underlying grievances. Consequently, I argue that the responses from the CHP\nand the BDP were supportive, but limited. There was a policy response, but it did not go very deep. There\nwas a platform response, but it framed the demands in the direction of pre-existing platforms. There was\nan organisational response and a response in terms of electoral strategies, but many of these were symbolic,\nand not accompanied by major changes in party platforms. In this sense, it may be useful to talk about\nthe institutional response to the Gezi protest as a creative process for these two political parties. When\nparty representatives spoke about the protests, they highlighted those issues where their party already had\nownership. Furthermore, while the BDP supported several of the protesters\u2019 demands, the CHP was more\nsupportive of the protest actors themselves. I use this finding to suggest an extension of the concept of the\nprotest paradigm in the social movement literature. Until now the protest paradigm has mainly been used\nto describe how antagonists of protests delegitimize protests, whereas I suggest that it is also is a possible\nstrategy for supportive actors.

Considering, however, that the recasting of freedom of religion has continued even\nafter the stagnation of EU conditionality, alternative explanations must be explored. I argue that the recent\nprocess of recasting the parameters of religious freedoms can be solely explained by neither the role of EU\nconditionality nor the reading of developments through separate alternative models. Though recent years\nhave witnessed several significant attempts combining various models in explaining the democratization\nprocess, no analysis to date has paid particular attention to religion and religious preferences, and I believe\nthis leads to an insufficient understanding of recent developments in relation to freedom of religion. In\norder to gain a comprehensive perspective, I have adopted an analytically eclectic approach benefitting from\nExternal Incentives, Social Learning and Lesson Drawing models and demonstrated how together they have\ninteractively shaped the parameters of freedom of religion throughout different time periods in the Turkish\nstate. I have employed a within-casecomparison methodology of three time periods (1999-2005/ 2005-2010/\n2011-2015), embracing a process-tracing method. Taking the results generated by applying these models to\nthe context in Turkey, I contend that EU conditionality was the initial motive behind the reform process in\nthe first time period analyzed, while growth of social dynamics has been observed only during the second\nperiod. Finally, the lesson drawing model, aka the AKP\u2019s preferences, have played a decisive role throughout\nall of the time periods examined.\nDefence date: 26 January 2017, Examining Board: Professor Olivier Roy, EUI (Supervisor); Professor Nil\u00fcfer\nG\u00f6le, EHESS; Professor \u015eahin Alpay, Bah\u00e7e\u015fehir University (Emeritus); Professor Donatella della Porta,\nfomerly EUI/SNS\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/45089"}, {"person": "Bruno De Witte", "affiliation": "European University Institute", "snippet": "different parts of the EMU.

I assess how\nfour political parties framed the protests, whether the latter were accompanied by changes in the parties\u2019\nplatforms and priorities, and whether politicians in office adjusted practical policies to accommodate protest\ndemands. In this research I draw on original data of parliamentary interventions, budget allocations, semistructured\ninterviews, and secondary sources, to answer these questions. The Gezi protests received a great\ndeal of attention from politicians, especially from the two opposition parties closest to the protests, the CHP\nand the BDP. However, both parties responded to the demands that aligned best with their pre-existing\nagendas, and with different loci of attention. The protests were also met with practical concessions on a few\nspecific demands. Yet these policy responses were narrowly targeted at the object and symbol of the initial\nprotests rather than at their underlying grievances. Consequently, I argue that the responses from the CHP\nand the BDP were supportive, but limited. There was a policy response, but it did not go very deep. There\nwas a platform response, but it framed the demands in the direction of pre-existing platforms. There was\nan organisational response and a response in terms of electoral strategies, but many of these were symbolic,\nand not accompanied by major changes in party platforms. In this sense, it may be useful to talk about\nthe institutional response to the Gezi protest as a creative process for these two political parties. When\nparty representatives spoke about the protests, they highlighted those issues where their party already had\nownership. Furthermore, while the BDP supported several of the protesters\u2019 demands, the CHP was more\nsupportive of the protest actors themselves. I use this finding to suggest an extension of the concept of the\nprotest paradigm in the social movement literature. Until now the protest paradigm has mainly been used\nto describe how antagonists of protests delegitimize protests, whereas I suggest that it is also is a possible\nstrategy for supportive actors.

According to this\nrationalist view, criminal decisions are nothing more nor less than the result of intellect-governed instrumental\nreasoning, aimed at maximizing one\u2019s pleasure to the detriment of the interests of other individuals. Therefore,\nculpability is grounded solely in offenders\u2019 cognitive intelligential faculties, by virtue of which offenders know\nthe meaning of their criminal actions, and thus willfully choose to act upon their antisocial impulses. While\ncognitive intellect is thought to be the only mental source of criminal decision-making, emotions are presumed\nto have no bearing on the deliberative processes leading to rational criminal choices. Criminal law thus excludes\nemotions from the essential mental components of culpability, as well as of culpability doctrines. The criminal\nlaw\u2019s rationalist model of the culpable agent quo calculating, emotionallycold actor collides with the huge body\nof neuroscientific literature about the influential role of emotions on (im)moral decision-making processes. For\nemotions appear to be critical in either informing, or hindering, moral decisions - and behavior\u2013, neuroscientific\ndisciplines vigorously hypothesize that antisocial behavior is also, and significantly, emotion-influenced rather\nthan solely cognition-driven. Drawing upon these scientific insights, this dissertation reforms the rationalist\ntenets of culpability by including emotions in its relevant psychological set. It therefore provides a broader\nparadigm of the \u201clegally relevant mind\u201d, one in which emotional, cognitive, and volitional spheres play an\nequally important role in determining criminal choices. It then offers a normative argument for reconsidering\nthe overall meaning of culpability in light of the real mental processes that undergird and guide moral decisionmaking\nand antisocial behavior. The argument emphasizes that an emotion-oriented understanding of\nculpability better reflects the meaning of blameworthiness, and exhibits greater compliance with the principle\nof personal guilt. The investigation then tests the newly developed emotion-oriented conception of culpability,\ninformed by moral neuroscience, on culpability doctrines \u2013 notably, the mens rea state of criminal intent,\ninsanity, and diminished capacity. After integrating the new paradigm of legally relevant mind in the respective\npsychological sets of said doctrines, the study reconsiders their conceptual substance, and provides revised\nformulations of their standards.

These models build on Karl-Heinz Ladeur\u2019s pioneering\nwork. Tort law developed in a society of individuals which is considered a radical break with prior methods\nof social organization. While the core of private law was contract law modelled on the abstract will, tort law\nset outer boundaries on the will but its shape was individualistic focusing on individualized conduct. In the\ntwentieth century, with the rise of the society of organizations, tort law was reshaped towards providing\nremedies fit for a society of organizations. This is evident both in terms of how tort law was adapted to the\nprivate firm and the state as service-provider. We find that the concept of vertical vicarious liability fits the\nway in which tort law abstracted from the reasonable man per se, to embrace the organizational setting in\nwhich agents conducted their activities. Our third paradigm, that of the society of networks, is emergent. It\nblurs lines between private and public and, additionally, the existing normative models of liability \u2013 whether\nindividualized or organizational \u2013 are not aligned.

Competition is shown\nto reduce individual bank and systemic stability by reducing banks\u2019 profit buffers to absorb liquidity shocks.\nThe impact of concentration on stability is more nuanced however, as increased concentration increases\nbanks\u2019 profit buffers but also increases the concentration risk in the interbank market, widening the channel\nof contagion by which a liquidity shock can spread throughout the network.

Competition is shown\nto reduce individual bank and systemic stability by reducing banks\u2019 profit buffers to absorb liquidity shocks.\nThe impact of concentration on stability is more nuanced however, as increased concentration increases\nbanks\u2019 profit buffers but also increases the concentration risk in the interbank market, widening the channel\nof contagion by which a liquidity shock can spread throughout the network.

This thesis aims to fill this gap between theory and practice.\nIn the first part, the dissertation puts forward a new and original conceptual toolkit for the analysis of\ngovernment alternation across countries and through time. Three dimensions, or faces, of the concept of\nalternation (i.e. actuality, possibility and probability) are singled out, defined and thoroughly operationalised.\nThis process of concept reconstruction makes it possible to paint a large historical fresco of the development\nof government alternation in Western Europe throughout the whole post-war period. The second part of\nthe thesis is devoted to the empirical analysis of the suggested determinants of alternation in government.\nAll the factors that may have an impact on the occurrence of alternation in its manifold manifestations are\nscrutinised and correlated to the diverse ways in which West European party systems change their cabinets\nacross space and time. Furthermore, the analysis carried out in this part of the thesis directly challenges\nmuch of the conventional wisdom that has accompanied the study of alternation since its uncertain inception.\nMore precisely, the results of the bivariate analyses show that the occurrence of alternation is not strictly correlated\nwith the fragmentation of the party systems or the proportionality of the electoral systems. Other factors, such as\nthe existence (and the strength) of anti-system parties, the role of pivotal actors, voters\u2019 availability to change their\nelectoral behaviour or the cabinet size, contribute to the explanation of the emergence and the persistence of a\npattern of alternation in government. In the last part of the thesis, I carried out a comparative time-series crosssection\nanalysis of the determinants of government alternation in seventeen West European countries. Partially,\nthis set of multivariate analyses confirms some of the evidence collected in the previous section. However, and\nin addition to that, the large-N statistical analysis demonstrates that different explanatory factors account for the\nvariation in the three dimensions of alternation suggested above. Moreover, the same argument holds true for\nthe explanation of the development of government alternation, in particular its accelerated rise since the 1980s.\nFinally, in the concluding chapter I analyse, firstly, the foreseeable evolution of government alternation in Western\nEurope, especially in relation to the impact of the current economic crisis on the functioning of West European\ndemocracies. Secondly, the chapter closes with the suggestion of a new typology of party systems based on the\nexistence of a bipolar pattern of inter-party competition and the possibility of a wholesale replacement of the\ngoverning parties.\nDefence date: 19 May 2017, Examining Board: Prof. Stefano Bartolini, EUI (Supervisor); Prof. Hanspeter Kriesi,\nEUI; Prof. Ferdinand M\u00fcller-Rommel, University of L\u00fcneburg; Prof. Gianfranco Pasquino, University of Bologna\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/46544"}, {"person": "Michelle Jackson", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "snippet": "This thesis brings together psychological and sociological research approaches to examine the role of\npersonality in the reproduction of educational and labour market inequality.

While other works try to explain ethnic violence at\nhighly aggregated national or regional levels, this dissertation analyzes the problem at neighborhood scale.\nTo analyze the spatial variation in violence and peace, this research employs the concepts of security dilemma\nand pact-making that are usually used in international relations and security studies.

Intracommunal policing is\na necessary condition for the efficient intercommunal pacts as strong in-group policing establishes firm\ndiscipline and order within community and signals to an out-group about the credible commitment to the\nterms of a pact.

This vernacular work by\nthe humanist John Foxe, entitled Acts and Monuments, was the largest account of martyrs produced by the\nReformation movement, being dedicated to the memory of hundreds of recently executed contemporaries.\nIt was also an innovative ecclesiastical history, aiming to supersede many traditional frames of reference,\nnotably by situating martyrs and other theological concepts within the context of Reformation history\nand doctrine. Even after the number of martyrs executed at the scaffold had diminished, educated elites,\ntheologians, divines, and the common people still grew up surrounded by Foxe\u2019s stories. While historians\nhave rightly situated Acts and Monuments within the urgent debates of the martyrologist\u2019s own time,\nrelatively few scholars have explored the subsequent development of ideas of martyrdom in the context of the\nlonger reformation. This doctoral thesis studies Foxe as a reformer and writer whose intellectual impact went\nbeyond the sixteenth century. In this regard, it is important to acknowledge that his works left many traces\non post-Reformation literary culture, and that the Foxeian martyrs continued to exercise a strong hold over\nthe popular imagination during the Stuart period. This study is essentially an attempt to establish exactly\nhow martyrs figured in historical understanding, and in what ways their example and authority determined\npatterns of reasoning. Focusing on a variety of literary sources written during the most famous disputes of\nthe seventeenth century, I seek to demonstrate the crucial position that recently executed martyrs occupied\nwithin the language of historical argument. My aim is also to show that Foxe\u2019s work provided a structure for\nmuch thinking during the early modern period, and that the examples of reformed martyrs were important\nin shaping public opinion throughout the Stuart dynasty. In short, this is a study of martyrs, their admirers,\nand the uses to which their stories were put in print. On a broader level, it is a study of ideas of martyrdom\nin the aftermath of the sixteenth-century British Reformations.\nDefence date: 12 December 2017, Examining Board: Professor Luca Mol\u00e0, European University Institute;\nProfessor Martin van Gelderen, Lichtenberg-Kolleg, University of G\u00f6ttingen; Professor Peter Lake, Vanderbilt\nUniversity; Professor Markku Peltonen University of Helsinki\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/50124"}, {"person": "Ronny Razin", "affiliation": "London School of Economics and Political Science", "snippet": "an election to choose a candidate.

I show that politicians who flip-flop, i.e. change their decision on\nthe issue, are penalized by voters, because flip-flopping signals incompetence. As a result, politicians have\nan incentive to protect their reputation by inefficiently sticking to their initial policy choice. This decreases\nthe quality of both policy and electoral choices. The paper also discusses how changes in transparency and\nterm limits can discipline the behaviour of politicians. My third and final chapter describes a media market in\nwhich a set of news outlets compete to break a news concerning a politician in office; after receiving a signal\nof whether the politician is corrupt, media outlets can either fact-check and learn the truth, or publish the\nnews immediately.

This thesis aims to fill this gap between theory and practice.\nIn the first part, the dissertation puts forward a new and original conceptual toolkit for the analysis of\ngovernment alternation across countries and through time. Three dimensions, or faces, of the concept of\nalternation (i.e. actuality, possibility and probability) are singled out, defined and thoroughly operationalised.\nThis process of concept reconstruction makes it possible to paint a large historical fresco of the development\nof government alternation in Western Europe throughout the whole post-war period. The second part of\nthe thesis is devoted to the empirical analysis of the suggested determinants of alternation in government.\nAll the factors that may have an impact on the occurrence of alternation in its manifold manifestations are\nscrutinised and correlated to the diverse ways in which West European party systems change their cabinets\nacross space and time. Furthermore, the analysis carried out in this part of the thesis directly challenges\nmuch of the conventional wisdom that has accompanied the study of alternation since its uncertain inception.\nMore precisely, the results of the bivariate analyses show that the occurrence of alternation is not strictly correlated\nwith the fragmentation of the party systems or the proportionality of the electoral systems. Other factors, such as\nthe existence (and the strength) of anti-system parties, the role of pivotal actors, voters\u2019 availability to change their\nelectoral behaviour or the cabinet size, contribute to the explanation of the emergence and the persistence of a\npattern of alternation in government. In the last part of the thesis, I carried out a comparative time-series crosssection\nanalysis of the determinants of government alternation in seventeen West European countries. Partially,\nthis set of multivariate analyses confirms some of the evidence collected in the previous section. However, and\nin addition to that, the large-N statistical analysis demonstrates that different explanatory factors account for the\nvariation in the three dimensions of alternation suggested above. Moreover, the same argument holds true for\nthe explanation of the development of government alternation, in particular its accelerated rise since the 1980s.\nFinally, in the concluding chapter I analyse, firstly, the foreseeable evolution of government alternation in Western\nEurope, especially in relation to the impact of the current economic crisis on the functioning of West European\ndemocracies. Secondly, the chapter closes with the suggestion of a new typology of party systems based on the\nexistence of a bipolar pattern of inter-party competition and the possibility of a wholesale replacement of the\ngoverning parties.\nDefence date: 19 May 2017, Examining Board: Prof. Stefano Bartolini, EUI (Supervisor); Prof. Hanspeter Kriesi,\nEUI; Prof. Ferdinand M\u00fcller-Rommel, University of L\u00fcneburg; Prof. Gianfranco Pasquino, University of Bologna\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/46544"}, {"person": "Philipp Genschel", "affiliation": "European University Institute", "snippet": "For all its powers, we know little about how the European Central Bank (ECB) makes its decisions and why.\nIn light of its ever-increasing importance in European governance and the criticism this has attracted, this is\nparticularly regrettable.

Based on the findings of this analysis, the strategic milestones required to achieve genuine ecosystem protection are identified and presented (Section 4).

The most\nimportant issues and methods at the centre of the social\nscience remain the same and observing how scholars were\nable to combine perspectives and methods across disciplines\nstill remains helpful in developing our own ability to do the\nsame.\nAlan S. Milward spanned several social science disciplines\nthroughout his career, acting successively as Associate\nProfessor of Economics at Stanford University, Professor of\nEuropean Integration History at the European University\nInstitute (1983-86 and 1996-2002), and Professor of\nEconomic History at the London School of Economics and\nPolitical Science.\nIn his research Alan Milward dealt with a variety of problems\nat the core of the social science: What is the role of economic\nforces in wars? Do conquests pay? What are the drivers of\neconomic development? What are the drivers of regional\nintegration? The work of Alan Milward can thus help us to\ntackle issues of interest across disciplinary boundaries. He\nwas able to tackle such problems by studying the modern\nhistory of Europe from World War II, but also the Industrial\nRevolution in nineteenth-century Europe. Using mainly the\nmethods of historians, his studies were based on archival\nmaterial. He achieved accurate descriptions of economic\nrealities in spite of the less developed means available in\nhis time.

In this thesis, I aim to research the neglected study of the European shipbuilding\nindustry from the late 1970s onwards. I first develop some theoretical arguments based on the rational\nchoice institutionalism and bargaining theory. Then, using strategic interaction analysis and conceptual\nexperiments, I propose a number of hypotheses in order to account for the changes in European\nshipbuilding policy over time. European legislation on state aid to shipbuilding is operationalised in the\nqualitative index as the dependent variable. The independent variables include the international market,\nthe number of European member states, international agreements and political decision-making rules.\nAfter the conceptual experiments, methodologically, I apply comparative statics to empirically assess\nwhether or not the explanatory variables have an impact on the output of European shipbuilding policy.\nThe empirical results indicate that international agreements and decision-making rules may lead to\nchanges in European shipbuilding policy. Furthermore, I extend the argument to another industrial\nsector, the European aerospace industry, based on the most similar case selection. However, evidence\nshows that international competition leads to an increase in R&D expenditure in aerospace, while\ninternational agreements merely play a marginal role. The different inferences drawn from these two\nsectors may be a result of their industrial characteristics, and this deepens our understanding for the\nIPE literature.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/18645"}, {"person": "Thomas Diez", "affiliation": "University of Birmingham", "snippet": "RUGE, Majda\nOvercoming division in Bosnia and Cyprus: The limits of international intervention\nEUI PhD theses, Department of Political and Social Sciences\nDefence date: 20 May 2011, Examining Board: Professor Michael Keating, European University\nInstitute (Supervisor) Professor Pascal Vennesson, European University Institute Professor Judy Batt,\nUniversity of Birmingham Professor Thomas Diez, University of T\u00fcbingen\nThe thesis provides a critical assessment of international involvement in the task of postconflict state\nconsolidation of Bosnia and Cyprus.

The thesis draws on data from four countries \u2013\nBritain, France, Ireland and Spain \u2013 over the past 15 years of electoral politics. The thesis provides a\ncomparative and longitudinal analysis of their strategies of politicisation and of depoliticisation in\nrelation with the parties? different statuses within their party systems (incumbent, mainstream\nopposition and peripheral opposition) and in three distinct arenas (national elections, European\nelections and EU referendums). It investigates how these parties have handled EU issues in three\ncomplementary dimensions of their activities: in their strategies of political communication, in intra-party\ndebates over the EU and in their responses to the consolidation of the European electoral arena. The\nthesis uses a mix-method approach based on claims-making analysis, thick qualitative comparisons\nand descriptive statistics. Contradicting the idea of a gradual europeanisation, it first provides evidence\nfor the stable marginalisation and nationalisation of EU affairs. Second, while the rise of euroscepticism\nis often discussed, the thesis demonstrates that conflicts over EU matters are rarely prominent in\npractice, and that they remain sporadic and confined to certain electoral channels, with mainstream\nparties actively compartmentalising the potential divisive effects of EU issues within their organisations.\nThird, it points to the centrality of the twofold behaviour of opposition parties, explaining why the\npoliticisation of EU matters has remained contextual and less linked to the role of radical parties than is\nusually recognised. It finally delineates a process of increasing seclusion between the national and\nEuropean political arenas that can be observed through the trajectories of MEPs careers in relation to\ntheir domestic political spaces or through the disengagement of national parties from campaigning in\nEU elections.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/19439"}, {"person": "Pedro Carneiro", "affiliation": "University College London", "snippet": "THUM, Anna-Elisabeth\nPsychological Factors and Labour Market Outcomes: The case of immigrants and their\nchildren in Germany\nEUI PhD theses, Department of Economics\nDefence date: 11 February 2011 Examining Board: Professor Richard Spady, Johns Hopkins University\n(External Supervisor) Professor J\u00e9rome Adda, European University Institute Professor Christian Belzil,\nEcole Polytechnique Professor Pedro Carneiro, University College London\nChapter I: Europe is facing the challenge of integrating a growing number of immigrants and their\noffspring.

The thesis addresses the question whether consumer\ncredit legislation is only regulated by economic law or also by social law and hence, whether it has a\nsocial dimension in addition to an economic one. Further, it discusses the implications of two competing\napproaches to consumer regulation, namely a free consumer credit market (neoliberal approach) and\none that is characterized by public intervention (social market approach). On the European level, the\nissue of the character of law which regulates consumer credit has consequences on the legislative\ncompetences shared by the EU and member states legislators in this respect. This is inseparable from\nthe question concerning the choice between the minimum or maximum harmonisation approaches. The\ncore argument of this thesis is that all above-mentioned aspects converge into a common focal point in\nthat there is tension between two fundamental goals of the European Community, namely economic\nefficiency (understood as a competitive market society) and consumer protection (understood as,\nbroadly speaking, a social justice society with its distributive role). The dissertation discusses whether\nand how these two goals can be reconciled, and which of them actually prevails in the EU consumer\ncredit legislation.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/16061"}, {"person": "Paolo Pinotti", "affiliation": "Bocconi University", "snippet": "WYSOKINSKA, Agnieszka\nImportance of History for Economic Development: Lessons from natural experiment of history\nEUI PhD theses, Department of Economics\nDefence date: 15 September 2011, Examining board: Luigi Guiso, European University Institute Andrea\nIchino (Supervisor), University of Bologna and EUI Leszek Jasinki, Institute of Economics Polish\nAcademy of Science Paolo Pinotti, Bocconi University\nDoes history matter for economic development?

Whereas the EU continues to strive for the further harmonisation of\nthe internal market, markets for digital services remain an exception, where barriers are artificially\nraised, rather than brought down. Yet why is harmonisation in this area so difficult to achieve? This\nthesis seeks to explain the reasons why creating a harmonised market for digital services is difficult to\nachieve by approaching the question in a multi-disciplinary way. It focuses not only on how the\nharmonisation of other aspects of copyright law have led to the development of laws which actually\nhinder the development of online services, but also on why copyright law has developed in such a\nrestrictive manner, by focusing on the role of industry lobbyists and policy makers in the development of\ncontemporary \u2018digital\u2019 copyright law. These findings are considered in light of economic analysis of the\ncopyright system, in order to demonstrate why the continued increases in levels of protection and terms\nof duration of copyright are not only unsupported by economic evidence, but actually appear to hinder\nthe development of new technologies and systems of distribution, making it increasingly difficult to\ncreate a single market for digital media distribution. Finally, this thesis will consider the role of collecting\nsocieties both online and offline, and how these institutions lead to a further fragmentation of a single\nmarket for digital media. While their existence in the physical monitoring of performances may be\nconsidered as a \u2018necessary evil\u2019, their existence in online distribution markets do not appear to be\nsupported by either law or economic evidence.

In other words, it investigates how adding the\nmonetary value (equalling to cost of production) of public childcare, non-tertiary and tertiary education,\nhealth care and elderly care services to a household\u2019s disposable income alters income distribution and\nhow efficiently public services work in the mechanism of redistribution. Moreover, it studies how the\npublic spending on these services is distributed across income classes and household types. Many\nprevious studies have already hinted that the omission of services from welfare state research may\ncontribute to a biased and deficient understanding of social policies. Besides, the inclusion of these\ncategories of social spending is likely to influence not only countries but also income classes and\nhousehold types in distinct ways \u2013 making this study all the more significant. While previous studies\nmay have incorporated health care and non-tertiary education within the concept of income, this thesis\npresents the first attempt to include childcare and elderly care services in research on income\ndistribution, as well as a more thorough analysis of higher education. Likewise, the use of a wider\ncomparative perspective to examine income inequality in social-democratic, conservative,\nMediterranean, postcommunist, and liberal welfare states contributes to the existing literature on\nEuropean social policies. The results of this thesis illustrate that in-kind benefits can function as a\nredistributive tool in European welfare states. Firstly, the quintile share ratio decreased on average by a\nthird when moving from disposable income to final income (excluding higher education that is more\npro-rich). Secondly, however, the variation both between countries and services is considerable, and\nthus different in-kind transfers should be analysed separately: the greatest impact on inequality is\nachieved through non-tertiary education and health care (17 and 16 per cent reduction respectively),\nwhile the inclusion of childcare and elderly care reduced inequality by 4 and 6 per cent on average. In\nthe social-democratic cluster, elderly care contributed much more efficiently on equal distribution of\nresources than elsewhere. Thirdly, we observe a pattern of redistribution towards the poor, even within\nsubgroups. Fourthly, the clustering of countries did not show a coherent pattern and it is especially hard\nto fit childcare to the traditional welfare state regime typology. Finally, we see that it is not only the level\nof public spending, or the comprehensiveness of coverage, that influence the received results in one\ndirection or the other, but also the socio-demographic structure of society and the equality of access to\nservices. In conclusion, further research should be conducted on the regional variations of the quality\nand quantity of services provided. Likewise, more effort should be devoted to studying the inequality of\naccess to different services (as undertaken here with higher education). In the context of economic\ncrisis and concern about the sustainability of public provision of services, this thesis aims at providing\nimportant evidence about egalitarian consequences of potential political reforms in the public services\nsector.

While this approach is often convenient, it\nrelies on very restrictive assumptions. In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing\na more satisfactory theory of decision making within households. The main contribution of this thesis is\nto explore the significance of intrahousehold risk sharing in the presence of uninsurable, idiosyncratic\nrisk. If individuals are unable to rely on complete asset markets, the extent to which they can cope with\nuncertainty crucially hinges on the set of risk sharing channels. Despite its vast empirical significance,\ninsurance from the family as one of these channels has mostly been overlooked in the literature. The\nfirst chapter investigates the significance of family insurance for savings and labor supply. An economy\nin which individuals can share risk within households generates aggregate precautionary savings that\nare substantially smaller than in a similar economy that lacks access to insurance from the family.\nIntrahousehold risk sharing has its largest impact among wealthpoor households. While the wealth-rich\nuse mainly savings to smooth consumption across unemployment spells, wealth-poor households rely\non spousal labor supply. The second chapter documents some stylized facts for the distributions of\nearnings and wealth across single and married households and presents a theoretical framework that\ncan successfully account for the data. Assortative matching, the effective tax bonus for married couple\nand directed bequests are found to be key determinants for higher per-capita earnings and net worth\namong married individuals. The third chapter explores how intrahousehold insurance interacts with the\ndesign of unemployment benefit programs. My findings indicate that fiscal policy can take very distinct\neffects depending on whether intra-household risk sharing is available or not.

Consequently, the hypotheses guiding this dissertation are as follows: (1) The more\ntransnational an individual, the more (s)he is prone to support European integration.

These hypotheses are\ntested using multilevel analyses of survey data from the Eurobarometer waves 65.1 (2006) and 67.1\n(2007).

It argues that systematisation in European law has a\nmuch wider impact than what is regularly perceived as rationalisation. It creates a new\nintegration-method, which economises European law to an extend that it effects the state-making and\nsociety building in EU law. In this respect, it also contributes to the legitimacy of EU legal action and\nshapes the EU constitution. Risk regulation forms an ideal test case for this thesis as it has emerged in\nrecent years from a sector-specific and reactive field of law to an increasingly coherent and autonomous\nlegal system at European level, which follows its own rules and procedures.

According to me, utopia is both a form of discourse and a\nset of particular practices. Thus, to be called utopian, a discourse has to include, first, a rejection of the\nexisting society, and second, if not a clear conception of what another world might look like, at least the\nidea that another society is possible and desirable. And, to be called utopian, practices need to be an\nattempt to create here and now at least some of the features of this utopian discourse, in the hope of a\nspread in the rest of society. This definition of utopia has been inscribed in a theoretical reflection linking\nthe concept to the other explanatory dimensions of social movements in order to see how bringing\nutopia in the debate can highlight some neglected aspects of collective action. In order to investigate the\npresence and the impact of utopia, I have decided to conduct a comparative case study within a single\nsocial movement: political consumerism. I understand political consumerism as a social movement in\nwhich a network of individual and collective actors criticize and try to differentiate themselves from\ntraditional consumerism by politicizing the act of buying in order to search for and promote other types\nof consumption. Thus I have observed four groups from two countries, France and the UK: two convivia\nof the Slow Food organization, a group of de-growth promoters surrounding the Casseurs de Pub and\nan intentional community living with the principles of ecovillages called Redfield Community. Through\nthe study of these groups, I have been able to uncover the \u201cgrammatical structure\u201d of their utopias and,\nthen, the content of these utopias. Once this done, I have observed the interactions between utopian\ndiscourses and utopian practices. Individually, utopias, through these interactions, end up shaping the\nwhole life of the activists and, collectively, they have consequences for many of the choices groups\nmake. They constrain them so that they choose means that are consistent with their ends, but they also\nhelp them move beyond some of the difficulties the groups meet. These interactions also involve an\nemotional work that is both directed towards the activists themselves and towards outsiders. Finally, I\nhave looked at the dialectical relationship that exists between utopia and the involvement people have\nin collective action. Activists use their utopias more or less consciously to have an impact on society,\nconvince others of the rightness of their cause and protect themselves against attacks from others.\nMoreover, utopia has a role in the positioning of these groups in the spaces of social movements and\npolitics.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/20061"}, {"person": "Anna Triandafyllidou", "affiliation": "European University Institute", "snippet": "TRIANDAFYLLIDOU, Anna\n(In)tolerance of Difference in Greek Schools: The case of migrant and Roma children,\nACCEPT-PLURALISM, 2011/06, 3.

Micklitz, EUI Dr. Maurizio Borghi, Brunel University Professor Molly S. van\nHouweling, UC Berkeley School of Law\nThe advent of Internet and digital technologies has radically transformed the way information is being\nproduced and consumed. The consequences for copyright law are twofold. While digital media provide\nnew opportunities for authors to produce and disseminate their works to the public, they simultaneously\nencourage and facilitate copyright infringement. Traditionally, in order to ensure compliance with the\nlaw, the copyright regime could rely upon the properties of physical media to constitute a natural barrier\nagainst copyright infringement. As the medium went digital, however, its properties became a catalyst\nfor infringement. Designed for the physical world, the structure of the copyright does not adequately\naddress the issues inherent to digital media. Private regulation therefore came into play in order to\nresolve the problem. While restrictive licensing agreements combined with technological measures of\nprotection purport to reestablish a technological barrier against copyright infringement, permissive\nlicenses such as Creative Commons purport to reduce the scope of protection granted by default under\nthe law. Although differing in method, these approaches share a common goal: to realign the properties\nof the work with the properties of the digital medium by readjusting the legal attributes and technical\ncharacteristics of digital copies. As a legal concept, however, the notion of a copy must be precisely\ndefined.

The piqueteros movement provides an outstanding scenario for the\ndynamic analysis of thirteen years of the intertwining logics of both contentious and routine politics. This\nthesis argues that the complete explanation for the interaction of social movements with state\ninstitutions must involve the less spectacular accumulation of ad hoc practices and the use of a\npredominant repertoire of strategies. The empirical argument of this dissertation is that the period\nbetween 1996 and 2009 represented a reshaping of the political arena through the second\nincorporation of workers under a non-corporatist logic. The territorialized path and specific logic of\nre-incorporation struggles in Argentina presents us with the crucial question of the redefinition of\nstate-society relations in the post-neoliberal era and its related re-incorporation struggles. The\ntheoretical purposes of this dissertation are manifold. The first is to suggest a refinement of the concept\nof political opportunities by specifying its logical location in the wider debate about the configuration of\nthe political context for social movement interaction. The second is to propose a series of concepts for\nthe analysis of strategic action in nonrational choice and/or structurally determinist terms. The threefold\nset of interrelated concepts I propose are: the stock of perceived alternatives; legacies; and repertoires\nof strategies. The third is to define the type of movement associated with the struggle for the redefinition\nof the actors to be included in the post-neoliberal political arena. Reincorporation movements have\nspecific attributes that define them as a particular expression of a historical process of struggle for\nincorporation that emerged with the neoliberal critical juncture.

Maastricht (Supervisor) Prof. Dr. Joop Hartog, University of Amsterdam (External\nSupervisor) Prof. Dr. Sven Steinmo, European University Institute Prof. Dr. Marc Hooghe, Katholieke\nUniversiteit Leuven\nThis dissertation has two main themes. First, it studies the role of social and cultural capital in\neducational achievement from a comparative perspective. Second, it investigates determinants of\nsocial trust among adolescents, where the theoretical framework combines insights from both political\nsocialization literature and social capital literature. The core of the thesis is three empirical papers. The\nfirst paper is novel in that it explores the relevance of social and cultural capital when measuring\nimprovement in children\u2019s educational achievement in two vastly different societies: Eastern and\nWestern Europe shortly after communism. My explicit question is not if social and cultural capital\ncontribute to educational outcomes, but whether this contribution is the same in different societies. In\nseeking the significance of the role of social and cultural capital, I used data from the Program for\nInternational Students Assessment (PISA) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n(TIMSS) which surveyed 50,000 eighth-grade pupils across Europe. Educational performance is\nmeasured by pupils test scores in mathematics. The second and third papers elaborate what is the\nsecond theme of this thesis: The origins of social trust among adolescents. In order to shed more light\non this issue, I distinguish between two different forms of social trust: generalized trust, which indicates\nhow much adolescents trust other people; and political trust, which indicates the extent to which they\ntrust government-related institutions. I conducted an empirical analysis of the data set from the 1999\nCivic Education Study conducted on 14-year old students across 18 countries. As a result, the second\npaper of this thesis examines the origins of generalized trust among the study\u2019s sample group, whereas\nthe third paper of this thesis explores determinants of political trust among adolescents. Both papers\nexamine the link between socialisation processes within the family and school and their effects on the\ndevelopment of generalized and political trust. In addition, they utilize institutional theories on the\ndevelopment of social trust, and test the proposition that the quality of governmental functioning affects\ndevelopment of generalized and political trust of citizens.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/18617"}, {"person": "Mark N.

Franklin, European University\nInstitute (Supervisor), Professor Stein Kuhnle, Hertie School of Governance and University of Bergen\nProfessor Alain No\u00ebl, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Professor Sven Steinmo, European University Institute\nWhy do some individuals show more support for international aid than others? And are people in donor\ncountries less supportive of the idea of aid than those in recipient countries? These are the primary\nquestions motivating this thesis, and the results can be summarized by four main findings. One is that\nthe level of economic development, which determines a country\u2019s status as a potential aid donor, has a\nstrong influence on support for aid, as citizens of more developed countries are considerably less in\nfavor of increasing aid than others are. The second finding is that, among donor countries, the level of\ndevelopment is positively related to several forms of opposition to the donation of aid. This appears\npartly due to the fact that more developed countries have donated more aid, for a longer period.\nRespondents in countries that donate more are more likely to find current levels of international aid\nsufficient, and this may explain part of the between-country differences. In other words, people in donor\ncountries may find the extent of international aid satisfactory at lower levels than those in other\ncountries. Most notably, however, people in more developed countries are more likely to state\ndisinterest as a reason for not supporting aid, and this reason is the only one that has a clear impact on\naggregate levels of support. There is also some evidence that greater donations increase skepticism\nregarding the impact of aid, but it is not clear that this affects aggregate support. Furthermore, the third\nfinding is that individual beliefs regarding the impact of aid are endogenous to support for aid. While\nsuch beliefs appear to influence the support for aid at the individual level, there is also a significant\neffect of support on the beliefs themselves. The fourth finding is that the negative relationship between\neconomic development and support holds for all but the very least developed countries of the world. It\nappears that respondents in the latter countries are living under such conditions they lack the critical\nopinions typically found in more developed countries, making it hard to compare them to those from\nmore developed countries.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/18401"}, {"person": "Hans-Wolfgang Micklitz", "affiliation": "European University Institute", "snippet": "LOBOCKA, Inga\nThe Evolution of EC Consumer Protection in the Field of Consumer Credit\nEUI PhD theses, Department of Law\nDefence date: 28 January 2011, Examining Board: Prof. Christian Joerges, University of Bremen\n(Supervisor) Prof. Hans-Wolfgang Micklitz, EUI Prof. Luisa Antoniolli, University of Trento Prof. Geraint\nHowells, University of Manchester\nUsing consumer credit regulation as a case study, this thesis investigates how the specific legislation in\nthis field can be explained by the major streams of economic philosophy. Based on an analysis of the\nevolution of European consumer credit legislation it is shown how the EU legislator\u2019s approach towards\nconsumer protection has changed and, more importantly, who are the addressees of this legislation.\nFinally, the thesis discusses how the role of contemporary consumers is conceptualized by European\nlegislators. It can be shown that EU consumer credit regulations are a perfect example for illustrating\nthe wider changes in EU consumer legislation. The thesis addresses the question whether consumer\ncredit legislation is only regulated by economic law or also by social law and hence, whether it has a\nsocial dimension in addition to an economic one. Further, it discusses the implications of two competing\napproaches to consumer regulation, namely a free consumer credit market (neoliberal approach) and\none that is characterized by public intervention (social market approach). On the European level, the\nissue of the character of law which regulates consumer credit has consequences on the legislative\ncompetences shared by the EU and member states legislators in this respect. This is inseparable from\nthe question concerning the choice between the minimum or maximum harmonisation approaches. The\ncore argument of this thesis is that all above-mentioned aspects converge into a common focal point in\nthat there is tension between two fundamental goals of the European Community, namely economic\nefficiency (understood as a competitive market society) and consumer protection (understood as,\nbroadly speaking, a social justice society with its distributive role). The dissertation discusses whether\nand how these two goals can be reconciled, and which of them actually prevails in the EU consumer\ncredit legislation.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/16061"}, {"person": "Elena Carletti", "affiliation": "European University Institute", "snippet": "CARLETTI, Elena, CORSETTI, Giancarlo, SIMONELLI, Saverio (ed/s)\nThe Macroeconomic and Financial Landscape in the Aftermath of the 2007 Crisis: New\nChallenges and Perspectives, EUI RSCAS PP, 2011/04, Global Governance Programme;\nThe paper by Thomas Cooley (New York University) discusses the challenges for the European Central\nBank in the current situation both in terms of long term fiscal adjustments and of potential fragility of the\nEuropean Banking system.

Its aim is twofold: on the one hand to elucidate the mechanisms of caste in social\nlife and in particular, to analyse how ex-untouchables negotiate caste stigma, and on the other, to\nexplore the caste, gender, and youth dimensions of the Ravidassia community in Catalonia, Spain. This\nstudy is comparative in nature, discussing caste, the management of caste stigma, and the Ravidassia\nsociocultural/religious movement in the Punjab, India and Catalonia, Spain. The Ravidassia community\nis an interesting case study for the study of caste, because the Ravidassias are the most important\nformer untouchable group demographically in both the Punjab and in the diaspora. They have also\nbecome in the postwar period one of India\u00b4s most economically and socially assertive \u00b4Scheduled\nCaste\u00b4 or SC caste groups, an assertion which is articulated symbolically in the field of religion. The\nRavidassias are thus an excellent example of a transnational group whose diaspora status is playing a\nkey role in changing the caste status quo in their native Punjab. In focusing on the individual experience\nof caste stigma, this thesis seeks to highlight an aspect of caste discrimination that is frequently\noverlooked in debates on \u00b4casteism\u00b4, and to reveal how Dalits who are now educated and middle-class\nstill struggle with the legacy of untouchability. During the course of my research, a significant portion of\nthe global Ravidassia community, including the Spanish Ravidassia community, chose to break with\nSikhism and form a completely autonomous religious identity. I thus had the privilege to witness a\nprofound identity shift on the part of my interviewees which has seen new forms of caste pride emerge\nthat would have been unthinkable only a generation ago. This ethnographic study reveals that while\ncaste prejudice/stigma has not diminished with migration, caste as institution and social organisation\nhas assumed new forms that can be strategically used by those who were once completely crushed by\nthe caste system.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/19438"}, {"person": "Andrea Ichino", "affiliation": "European University Institute", "snippet": "GRANADOS ZAMBRANO, Paulina\nUnderstanding Individuals\u2019 Beliefs\nEUI PhD theses, Department of Economics\nDefence date: 6 May 2011, Jury Members: Prof. Luigi Guiso Supervisor, EUI Prof. Andrea Ichino,\nUniversity of Bologna Prof. Eleonora Patacchini, Universit\u00e0 di Roma \u201cLa Sapienza\u201d Prof. Andrea\nRepetto, Adolfo Iba\u00f1ez University, Chile\nWe live in a world surrounded by uncertainty and within this uncertainty human beings have to decide\nevery action, every turn of life.

So far, the analysis of race and racism in legal scholarship has mainly occurred in\nterms of traditional dogmatic criteria. Here instead, civil law jurisdictions of Europe will be looked at\nthrough the prism of Critical Race Theory, an American legal theory that has placed the problematic\nrelationship between race and law in the United States at the core of its scholarship. What emerges\nfrom that perspective is that in spite of the general idea that race and ethnicity played only a marginal\nand exceptional role in mainland European legal systems, law is just as deeply involved in constructing\nand discriminating racial minorities, albeit in somehow different ways. In particular, this claim is\nsubstantiated by problematizing the historically conditioned reluctance in mainland European states to\nspeak and research in terms of \u2018race\u2019. In the legal domain this position translates into proposals to\neliminate race from constitutional and legislative provisions and into very narrow legal definitions and\nperceptions of what is racism and who is deemed to be racist.

The piqueteros movement provides an outstanding scenario for the\ndynamic analysis of thirteen years of the intertwining logics of both contentious and routine politics. This\nthesis argues that the complete explanation for the interaction of social movements with state\ninstitutions must involve the less spectacular accumulation of ad hoc practices and the use of a\npredominant repertoire of strategies. The empirical argument of this dissertation is that the period\nbetween 1996 and 2009 represented a reshaping of the political arena through the second\nincorporation of workers under a non-corporatist logic. The territorialized path and specific logic of\nre-incorporation struggles in Argentina presents us with the crucial question of the redefinition of\nstate-society relations in the post-neoliberal era and its related re-incorporation struggles. The\ntheoretical purposes of this dissertation are manifold. The first is to suggest a refinement of the concept\nof political opportunities by specifying its logical location in the wider debate about the configuration of\nthe political context for social movement interaction. The second is to propose a series of concepts for\nthe analysis of strategic action in nonrational choice and/or structurally determinist terms. The threefold\nset of interrelated concepts I propose are: the stock of perceived alternatives; legacies; and repertoires\nof strategies. The third is to define the type of movement associated with the struggle for the redefinition\nof the actors to be included in the post-neoliberal political arena. Reincorporation movements have\nspecific attributes that define them as a particular expression of a historical process of struggle for\nincorporation that emerged with the neoliberal critical juncture.

Micklitz, EUI (Supervisor) Prof.\nDr. Ellen Vos, University of Maastricht\nThis thesis explores the impact of the increasing role of systematisation in European law on the\nexample of EU risk regulation as a reference area. It argues that systematisation in European law has a\nmuch wider impact than what is regularly perceived as rationalisation. It creates a new\nintegration-method, which economises European law to an extend that it effects the state-making and\nsociety building in EU law. In this respect, it also contributes to the legitimacy of EU legal action and\nshapes the EU constitution. Risk regulation forms an ideal test case for this thesis as it has emerged in\nrecent years from a sector-specific and reactive field of law to an increasingly coherent and autonomous\nlegal system at European level, which follows its own rules and procedures. While within the two main\nregimes of risk regulation, which I call \u2018new approach\u2019 and \u2018new governance\u2019, systematisation\ndeveloped at a different speed and under different circumstances, these concepts are increasingly\nmerged at European level. When I talk about the technique of systematisation, however, this concept\nrequires adjustment as to the features of European law. While systematisation has been a main feature\nof the state-making agenda of nation-states, the same technique of systematisation in the EU\nnowadays creates a common market. Hence, in the EU, systematisation is in the first sense a tool of\neconomisation.

My first, humble, contribution to designing\nthese are the three papers in this thesis. As an introduction, I will proceed to briefly describe their\ncontributions. In the first paper, I address the question of how diverse opinions (\u201cbeliefs\u201d) among\nmembers of a monetary policy committee [MPC], as well as its institutional features, in particular, its\nsize and its decision-making process, influence macroeconomic volatility. I answer this question in two\nparts: first, I explain the relationship between decision-making in committees and robust, or\nregret-minimising, decision-making. I show that the two can be equivalent under very specific conditions\n(on beliefs and the potential models of the economy). These conditions are hard to test empirically;\ntherefore, I proceed, in the second part, to simulate an empirically motivated example, and, to compare\nthe volatility generated by a, hypothetical, robust decision-maker, with actual volatility generated by the\ncommittee of the Bank of England [BoE], and, by several, differently specified, committees. I find, that\nunder reasonable parameterisations, committee decision-making resembles robust decision-making. In\naddition, it turns out that greater diversity and aspiration towards consensus make monetary policy\n\u201cmore robust\u201d. At the time of writing, disagreements among MPC members were often reduced only to\nincrement changes of the interest rate. Nowadays, however, disagreements concern, for example,\nacceptable debt levels and are much deeper and more fiercely debated. The framework, then,\nsuggests, for example, that the departure of conservative central bankers from the governing council of\nthe European Central Bank [ECB] reduces the robustness of its decisions, and that robust Federal\nOpen Market Committee [FOMC] policies (see Ellison & Sargent, 2009) may be an artefact of\ninstitutional structures, and not, as the authors suspect, of policymakers\u2019 mindsets. In the second\nchapter, I turn to the issue of bank regulation, and, in particular, to the question of how the integration of\ncommercial lending, and, investment banking, influences underwriting quality. Contributing to an old,\nbut re-animated debate, I introduce mergers & acquisition [M&A] as a source of investment banking\nrevenues in a benchmark model of universal banks (Kanatas & Qi, 2003). The analysis illustrates, that,\nwhen assessing the effects of financial services integration, a distinction has to be made between the\neffects of administrative synergies, such as the joint use of computers or staff, and informational\nsynergies. The latter, should also be treated differently, depending on whether they constitute strategic\ninformational gains, e.g. from underwriting, or non-strategic gains, for example, from standardised\ncredit applications. It turns out that, ceteris paribus, and, under perfect competition, strategic efficiency\ngains improve incentives for higher underwriting quality, while non-strategic gains (administrative and\ninformational) induce banks to depreciate the quality of their provided services. In the paper, I then\nprovide conditions for the many intermediate cases. I also show that higher monopolistic rents lead to\nbetter underwriting quality, and, that deregulation can create risks for aggregate economic activity.

Trechsel, European University\nInstitute (Supervisor) Prof. Peter Mair, European University Institute Prof. Russell J. Dalton, University\nof California at Irvine Prof. Jan W. van Deth, University of Mannheim\nThis thesis aims to explain levels and changes in levels of political participation through institutions and\ninstitutional change. Three general trends have been distinguished; a decline in \u2018representative\u2019\nparticipation, an increase in \u2018extra-representative\u2019 participation, and an increase in \u2018direct\u2019 participation.\nThe notion that these trends are apparent in most established democracies is rather striking and\npuzzling. This study specifically contributes to the debate about the current state and health of\ndemocracy, considering that it is concerned with both system changes in democracies and levels of\npopular participation in these democracies. Changes in these types of participation could partly be\nexplained by changes in the structure of the political system. Although the notion that institutions matter\nin political life is not debated, and their effects have been examined before, the effects of institutions\nhave rarely been examined structurally in large-scale analyses, specifically concerning participation. In\nthis study, three institutional elements which affect the access points and inclusiveness of the political\nsystem are considered: \u2018horizontal\u2019 diffusion of responsibilities (privatisation; the creation of\nnon-majoritarian institutions), \u2018vertical\u2019 diffusion of responsibilities (decentralisation; globalisation) and\n\u2018diagonal\u2019 diffusion of responsibilities (direct democracy institutionalisation). The main aim of this\nresearch is therefore to find to what extent changes in the political system influence levels of different\nforms of political participation, over time and across space. The study finds that, generally,\nrepresentative participation seems to be negatively affected by privatisation, non-majoritarian\ninstitutions, globalisation, and the institutionalisation of referendums, with unclear results regarding the\nimpact of decentralisation. Extrarepresentative participation is generally positively influenced by\nprivatisation, nonmajoritarian institutions, decentralisation, and globalisation, while there are some\nmixed results concerning the influence of the institutionalisation of referendums.

The present research project focuses on the link\nbetween descriptive and symbolic representation and seeks to understand what consequences a more\nproportional political environment produces on the attitudes of both underrepresented and\noverrepresented groups towards the political system. Women remain among the least politically\nrepresented groups and therefore this project focuses on and analyses them in various political\npositions. Two dimensions of the relationship between citizens and politics are analysed: the level of\npolitical engagement and the evaluation of the political system.

This dissertation reaches three important achievements.\nThe first one is to develop the first theoretical framework of the potential causal mechanisms that are\nlikely to operate behind the impact that female politicians have on both women and men. The second is\nto show that men can indeed be positively influenced but mainly to clarify that the way they evaluate the\npolitical system is nearly the only way they are affected \u2013 their level of political engagement does not\nchange.

This work seeks to enhance the literature in three different ways. First of all,\nparty and party system institutionalization are clearly considered as two different, although related,\nphenomena. Second, and building on Mair (1996, 2001), it attempts to advance party system analyses\nby improving the operationalization of institutionalization. In this context, a new operationalization which\nis both conceptually and empirically superior to the existing ones is suggested. Finally, and contrary to\nthe tendency of explaining party system formation and development using either an institutional or a\nsociological approach, a serious effort is made to bring the two approaches together when examining\nthe process of party system institutionalization in new democracies. The analysis here undertaken\nindicates that party system institutionalization in new East Central European democracies has been\nenhanced by both supportive institutional structures (i.e. political parties, electoral systems, type of\nregime) and strong \u201ccleavage\u201d structuration. The idea is that as individual political parties\ninstitutionalized (i.e. develop stable roots in society and solid organizations), they help voters to make\nthe political expression of social cleavages more consistent, thereby avoiding instability in the patterns\nof inter-party competition for government. Second, party system format, itself a function of the type of\nelectoral system adopted, also plays a role.

In Western Europe employment trends since the 1970s\nabove all have casted doubt on the feasibility of active statehood. At the same time, governments have\nproven conspicuously unable to renounce their commitment to the promise, so central to modern\nindustrial society, of an economy that serves man, and provides decent, socially valuable work for all\nwho seek it. This has been true in particular for the German welfare state and its deeply rooted reliance\non the imagery of full \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018quality\u2019 employment as a critical touchstone for policy makers. It is the\nseeming paradox that German governments have sought justification for employment policy after the\nmid-1970s primarily through liberalization that this thesis addresses. The argument draws on a\ntheoretical framework that champions \u2018ideas\u2019 as the dual foundation of policy making \u2013 in the form of\ninstitutionally supported knowledge that defines the practice of making policy in a democratic context,\nand as the semantic structures internal to policy related arguments that determine which aspects of a\ngiven policy reality can come to inform rational policy projects. Based on an analysis of the semantic\nstructures underlying employment debates in Germany, and the arguments with which policy makers\nhave designed and justified legislative initiatives, the thesis draws attention to the relation between the\nnormative tensions faced by policy makers and the nature of diagnostic arguments through which\nemployment problems are interpreted through time as a key to understanding rhetorical choices. The\ndiagnostic framework that informed the liberalization of German employment policy then becomes\nintelligible as the politically most viable and pragmatic solution to the rhetorical problem of reconciling\nmultiple and conflicting demands on state authority.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/18646"}, {"person": "Christopher Wlezien", "affiliation": "Temple University", "snippet": "WEBER, Till\nThe Structuring Effect of Electoral Competition\nEUI PhD theses, Department of Political and Social Sciences\nDefence date: 6 June 2011, Examining Board: Professor Mark Franklin, European University Institute\n(Supervisor), Professor Fabrizio Bernardi, European University Institute Professor Bernhard We\u00dfels,\nSocial Science Research Center Berlin , Professor Christopher Wlezien, Temple University\nDemocratic politics are structured by elections. Governments come and go, campaigns come and go,\npolicies come and go, and so forth. In representative democracy, the mere existence of elections\nstrongly alters the behavior of representatives who are interested in re-election and of voters who are\naffected by political communication. Unlike many of our models, the real world structures politics\nthrough time, and especially through time between elections. When elections approach, democratic\nsystems seem to be transformed to a degree that facilitates the analysis of a wide variety of campaign\neffects. Voters and parties do not change significantly through the electoral cycle. Their environment\ndoes. The aim of this book is to develop concrete theory for the functioning of political time and to\ndemonstrate its effects with empirical data. At the core of the theory is a dual mobilization cycle. One leg\nof this cycle concerns the creation and decay of structure in voting behavior. The book traces the causal\npath preceding the result: the dynamics of voter perceptions, the determinants of party preference, and\nthe logic of turnout and choice. The other leg of the dual cycle concerns the configuration of the party\nsystem. Here the causal path leads from the dimensions of conflict within parties over the ability of the\nleadership to enforce unity in parliamentary behavior to the implementation of campaign strategies. The\nbook also spells out the connections between the two legs and locates them in political time. The\nmethodology developed for this purpose, labeled \u201cQuasi Time Series,\u201d serves to transform\ncross-sectional data (which are available in abundance) in a way so that they fulfill functions of time\nseries (which are exceedingly rare). The comparative approach exploits data from several decades,\ndozens of countries, hundreds of parties, thousands of legislators and about 100,000 voters.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/18408"}, {"person": "Jan Beyers", "affiliation": "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven", "snippet": "ROZBICKA, Patrycja\nMyths and Reality of EU Policy Processes and Interest-Groups Participation.

This thesis suggests that an analytical approach must be taken in studies on\nconsumption paying special attention to the socio-cultural and economic transfers which occur when\ndifferent commodities are introduced to territories with diverse socio-cultural values and identities.\nTherefore one of the key questions of such an analysis is to examine the role of merchants, who have a\nvery important influence on consumer decisions. This thesis describes the new necessities created by\nmerchants, as \u201cvicarious consumers\u201d, inserted in local, national and international market circuits in the\nWestern Mediterranean area. The increase in the consumption of new goods during the eighteenth\ncentury in south-eastern Spain, especially during the second half of the century, entailed changes in\nhousehold economies through some improvements in everyday life. The systematic analysis of probate\ninventories demonstrates potential shifts in the consumption of new durable and semi-durable goods in\nurban and rural families. Certainly, in south-eastern Spain, there was an interest in consuming new,\nexotic and foreign goods. The desires, aspirations and choices of individuals are demonstrated to have\nbeen inspired by a global movement, in which human and material capital circulated trans-continentally,\nshifting the patterns of consumption of societies - whose values and traditions were challenged by the\nacquisition of new material goods. I will not simply analyse those relevant theories applied to material\nculture studies related to Occidental or Oriental societies, such as the \u201cindustrious revolution\u201d or\n\u201ctrickle-down\u201d approaches (which have been applied mostly in developed economies to explain stages\nprior to the Industrial Revolution process).

My first, humble, contribution to designing\nthese are the three papers in this thesis. As an introduction, I will proceed to briefly describe their\ncontributions. In the first paper, I address the question of how diverse opinions (\u201cbeliefs\u201d) among\nmembers of a monetary policy committee [MPC], as well as its institutional features, in particular, its\nsize and its decision-making process, influence macroeconomic volatility. I answer this question in two\nparts: first, I explain the relationship between decision-making in committees and robust, or\nregret-minimising, decision-making. I show that the two can be equivalent under very specific conditions\n(on beliefs and the potential models of the economy). These conditions are hard to test empirically;\ntherefore, I proceed, in the second part, to simulate an empirically motivated example, and, to compare\nthe volatility generated by a, hypothetical, robust decision-maker, with actual volatility generated by the\ncommittee of the Bank of England [BoE], and, by several, differently specified, committees. I find, that\nunder reasonable parameterisations, committee decision-making resembles robust decision-making. In\naddition, it turns out that greater diversity and aspiration towards consensus make monetary policy\n\u201cmore robust\u201d. At the time of writing, disagreements among MPC members were often reduced only to\nincrement changes of the interest rate. Nowadays, however, disagreements concern, for example,\nacceptable debt levels and are much deeper and more fiercely debated. The framework, then,\nsuggests, for example, that the departure of conservative central bankers from the governing council of\nthe European Central Bank [ECB] reduces the robustness of its decisions, and that robust Federal\nOpen Market Committee [FOMC] policies (see Ellison & Sargent, 2009) may be an artefact of\ninstitutional structures, and not, as the authors suspect, of policymakers\u2019 mindsets. In the second\nchapter, I turn to the issue of bank regulation, and, in particular, to the question of how the integration of\ncommercial lending, and, investment banking, influences underwriting quality. Contributing to an old,\nbut re-animated debate, I introduce mergers & acquisition [M&A] as a source of investment banking\nrevenues in a benchmark model of universal banks (Kanatas & Qi, 2003). The analysis illustrates, that,\nwhen assessing the effects of financial services integration, a distinction has to be made between the\neffects of administrative synergies, such as the joint use of computers or staff, and informational\nsynergies. The latter, should also be treated differently, depending on whether they constitute strategic\ninformational gains, e.g. from underwriting, or non-strategic gains, for example, from standardised\ncredit applications. It turns out that, ceteris paribus, and, under perfect competition, strategic efficiency\ngains improve incentives for higher underwriting quality, while non-strategic gains (administrative and\ninformational) induce banks to depreciate the quality of their provided services. In the paper, I then\nprovide conditions for the many intermediate cases. I also show that higher monopolistic rents lead to\nbetter underwriting quality, and, that deregulation can create risks for aggregate economic activity.

Only a few papers look at the empirical effects of the\nmonetary shock on the firm turnover measures. But what can we learn about monetary transmission by\nincluding measures for firm turnover into the theoretical and empirical models? Based on a large scale\nvector autore- gressive (VAR) model for the U.S. economy I show that a contractionary monetary policy\nshock increases the number of business bankruptcy filings and failures, and decreases the creation of\nfirms and net entry. According to the limited participation model, a contractionary monetary shock leads\nto a drop in the number of firms. On the contrary the same shock in the sticky price model increases the\nnumber of firms. Therefore the empirical findings support more the limited participation type of monetary\ntransmission., Chapter 2: We introduce deep habits into a sticky-price sticky-wage economy and\nexamine the resulting models ability to account for the impact of monetary policy shocks. The deep\nhabits mechanism gives rise to countercyclical markup movements even when prices are flexible and\ninteracts with nominal rigidities in interesting ways. Key parameters are estimated using a limited\ninformation approach. The deep habits model can account very precisely for the persistent impact of\nmonetary policy shocks on aggregate consumption and for both the price puzzle and inflation\npersistence. A key insight is that the deep habits mechanism and nominal rigidities are complementary:\nThe deep habits model can account for the dynamic effects of monetary policy shock at low to\nmoderate levels of nominal rigidities. The results are shown to be stable over time and not caused by\nmonetary policy changes., Chapter 3: In a standard New-Keynesian DSGE model exogenous price\nmarkup and cost-push shocks generate most of the volatility in inflation. The key equation determining\ninflation is the New Keynesian Phillips curve. Several authors have proposed mod- ifications to the\nforward looking Phillips curve. In this paper I concentrate on the effects of endogenous markups due to\nfirm turnover and the importance of financial friction. My findings show that entry cost shocks are\nimportant in explaining the dynamics of inflation at the business cycle frequency.

So far, the analysis of race and racism in legal scholarship has mainly occurred in\nterms of traditional dogmatic criteria. Here instead, civil law jurisdictions of Europe will be looked at\nthrough the prism of Critical Race Theory, an American legal theory that has placed the problematic\nrelationship between race and law in the United States at the core of its scholarship. What emerges\nfrom that perspective is that in spite of the general idea that race and ethnicity played only a marginal\nand exceptional role in mainland European legal systems, law is just as deeply involved in constructing\nand discriminating racial minorities, albeit in somehow different ways. In particular, this claim is\nsubstantiated by problematizing the historically conditioned reluctance in mainland European states to\nspeak and research in terms of \u2018race\u2019. In the legal domain this position translates into proposals to\neliminate race from constitutional and legislative provisions and into very narrow legal definitions and\nperceptions of what is racism and who is deemed to be racist.

However,\nand in spite of the fact that the question of Spanish-Italian diplomatic relations between 1943 and 1957\nwill remain at the heart of this research, this is not merely a history of bilateral relations. In fact, the\npresent work contends that this bilateral relationship cannot be studied in isolation and that a broader\ncontext is key, in order to obtain a full understanding of it. In this way, this research will also focus on\nhow these two countries responded to the challenges of the post-war period, and how they struggled to\npursue a more independent foreign policy with respect to the major powers. Hence, it is clearly\nimportant to analyse the degree of influence which Great Britain first and the United States afterwards\nexerted both in Spain and Italy and over their relations. The role of France will also be scrutinised,\nalthough it will be under a different light, since France did not possess the material capabilities to display\na hegemonic policy in Western Europe after 1943. However, the French role in Spanish- Italian relations\ncannot be ignored either, especially after 1950 when the diplomats at the \u2018Quai D\u2019Orsay\u2019 began to\nintervene more actively in the affairs of the two neighbouring states. Therefore, this research will also\naddress the question of how much room for manoeuvre the Spanish and the Italian Governments really\nhad in the diplomatic field. By accomplishing these objectives, the present research will enrich the\nexisting field of scholarship of both the Spanish and Italian foreign policies after the Second World War\nand, at the same time, it will contribute to obtaining a better understanding of international relations in\nWestern Europe during the post-war period and, especially the role of the major powers.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/18398"}, {"person": "Hans-Peter Blossfeld", "affiliation": "European University Institute", "snippet": "KOHLI, Martin\nForeword\nHans-Peter BLOSSFELD, Sandra BUCHHOLZ and Karin KURZ (eds), Aging Populations,\nGlobalization and the Labor Market: Comparing late working life and retirement in modern societies,\nCheltenham, Edward Elgar, 2011, xvii-xix;\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/20877"}, {"person": "Hara Kouki", "affiliation": "European University Institute", "snippet": "DELLA PORTA, Donatella\nSocial Movement Studies and Transnationalization: An uneasy relation or a happy start?

The thesis draws on data from four countries \u2013\nBritain, France, Ireland and Spain \u2013 over the past 15 years of electoral politics. The thesis provides a\ncomparative and longitudinal analysis of their strategies of politicisation and of depoliticisation in\nrelation with the parties? different statuses within their party systems (incumbent, mainstream\nopposition and peripheral opposition) and in three distinct arenas (national elections, European\nelections and EU referendums). It investigates how these parties have handled EU issues in three\ncomplementary dimensions of their activities: in their strategies of political communication, in intra-party\ndebates over the EU and in their responses to the consolidation of the European electoral arena. The\nthesis uses a mix-method approach based on claims-making analysis, thick qualitative comparisons\nand descriptive statistics. Contradicting the idea of a gradual europeanisation, it first provides evidence\nfor the stable marginalisation and nationalisation of EU affairs. Second, while the rise of euroscepticism\nis often discussed, the thesis demonstrates that conflicts over EU matters are rarely prominent in\npractice, and that they remain sporadic and confined to certain electoral channels, with mainstream\nparties actively compartmentalising the potential divisive effects of EU issues within their organisations.\nThird, it points to the centrality of the twofold behaviour of opposition parties, explaining why the\npoliticisation of EU matters has remained contextual and less linked to the role of radical parties than is\nusually recognised. It finally delineates a process of increasing seclusion between the national and\nEuropean political arenas that can be observed through the trajectories of MEPs careers in relation to\ntheir domestic political spaces or through the disengagement of national parties from campaigning in\nEU elections.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/19439"}, {"person": "Ioannis Lianos", "affiliation": "University College London", "snippet": "SVETLICINII, Alexandr\nAssessing Non-horizontal Mergers: The role of legal rules and integration of economic\nanalysis\nEUI PhD theses, Department of Law\nDefence date: 7 March 2011, Examining Board: Prof. Dr. Heike Schweitzer, Universit\u00e4t Mannheim/EUI\n(EUI Supervisor) Prof. Dr. Giorgio Monti, EUI Prof. Dr. Jules Stuyck, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Dr.\nIoannis Lianos, University College London\nThis thesis is targeting a complex topic of integration of economic analysis (economic theories and\nevidence) into the legal framework of EU merger control.

The present research project focuses on the link\nbetween descriptive and symbolic representation and seeks to understand what consequences a more\nproportional political environment produces on the attitudes of both underrepresented and\noverrepresented groups towards the political system. Women remain among the least politically\nrepresented groups and therefore this project focuses on and analyses them in various political\npositions. Two dimensions of the relationship between citizens and politics are analysed: the level of\npolitical engagement and the evaluation of the political system. While there is a clear gender gap in the\nformer, the same does not apply to the latter. This dissertation reaches three important achievements.\nThe first one is to develop the first theoretical framework of the potential causal mechanisms that are\nlikely to operate behind the impact that female politicians have on both women and men. The second is\nto show that men can indeed be positively influenced but mainly to clarify that the way they evaluate the\npolitical system is nearly the only way they are affected \u2013 their level of political engagement does not\nchange. The third achievement is to show that, while most scholarship has been focusing on the topic\npolitical involvement, the presence of female politicians seems to be more connected to the way women\nevaluate the political system. This means that the \u2018role model effect\u2019 is not the main mechanism at work\nhere. Instead, the idea that the presence of women is necessary to represent women\u2019s interests and the\nfact that they are seen as bringing something new into the political world appear more influential factors.\nAltogether the signs of the impact of the presence of female politicians are modest.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/20062"}, {"person": "Ron Levi", "affiliation": "University of Toronto", "snippet": "DEZALAY, Sara\nRevamping Law by Circumventing the State: Non-governmental organizations in the\ninternational management of social violence on the African continent\nEUI PhD theses, Department of Law\nDefence date: 21 June 2011, Examining Board: Professor Pierre-Marie Dupuy, Graduate Institute of\nInternational and Development Studies, Geneva (EUI Supervisor), Professor Johanna Sim\u00e9ant\nCESSP-CNRS Paris I-Sorbonne (External Supervisor) Professor Ron Levi Departments of political\nscience and sociology University of Toronto, Professor Christian Reus-Smit, EUI, Political and Social\nSciences Department\nThis thesis explores the social usages of the law in scholarly and professional spaces, in the North, that\nare sites of production and legitimation of tools devised to diagnose and prescribe solutions over armed\nconflicts on the African continent since the end of the Cold war.

Traditionally, the formation of customary international law is constituted of\ntwo elements, state practice and opinio juris, in other words, the action of states and the subjective\nbelief that the action is required by law. On occasions, however, the rules labelled under customary\ninternational law are not found through the process of establishing state practice and opinio juris, but\nstem from other normative considerations, as the case-study of international criminal tribunals\nillustrates. This thesis examines the nature of customary international law and the \u2018modernised\u2019 version\nof it; what distinguishes the traditional and novel concepts; where do they arise from - the process of\ntheir formation; and their relationship with other sources of international law. The critical analysis\nconcentrates on this transformed process of discovering rules categorised as customary international\nlaw, and the impact of this novel process on the understanding of the nature of customary international\nlaw, as well as on the legitimacy of the resulting rules. The thesis does not, finally, purport to renounce\nthe expansion of the sources of international law, but rather directs the criticism on the methods of\nfinding customary international law and the compliance to the principle of legality, and notes that\ncriminal trials may not be the appropriate venues for the discovery of novel sources of law or the explicit\nextension of the scope of existing sources.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/16055"}, {"person": "Harold James", "affiliation": "European University Institute", "snippet": "CARLETTI, Elena, CORSETTI, Giancarlo, SIMONELLI, Saverio (ed/s)\nThe Macroeconomic and Financial Landscape in the Aftermath of the 2007 Crisis: New\nChallenges and Perspectives, EUI RSCAS PP, 2011/04, Global Governance Programme;\nThe paper by Thomas Cooley (New York University) discusses the challenges for the European Central\nBank in the current situation both in terms of long term fiscal adjustments and of potential fragility of the\nEuropean Banking system.

The joint\npaper by Franklin Allen (University of Pennsylvania) and Elena Carletti (EUI) turn the attention to the\nissue of systemic risk and the need for macroprudential regulation. Finally, Luigi Guiso (EUI) tackles the\nissue of trust and risk aversion in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

On the basis of a\nWittgensteinian understanding of language and meaning, I defend two interrelated claims: the claim\nthat some propositions are beyond reasonable doubt in moral practices and the claim that\nunderstanding moral principles amounts to the mastery of those practices. My reflections on a number\nof propositions which it seems impossible to doubt from a moral standpoint lead me to the view that for\na morally competent agent, some propositions are removed from doubt. In conceiving of justification as\na response to doubt based on reasons, I follow Wittgenstein and those contemporary philosophers who\ndefend what are called \u2018contextualist\u2019 approaches. Given the close relationship between justification\nand doubt, the claim that some propositions are beyond reasonable doubt in moral practices implies\nthat certain philosophical demands for justification make no sense. Like contextualists, I oppose both\nfoundationalist and coherentist accounts of moral justification and moral knowledge. Unlike them, I\nargue that moral knowledge ultimately amounts to knowledge how. This practical knowledge involves\ncognitive as well as emotional capacities, which are developed through training. On the basis of my\naccount of moral competence, I am able to reject the view that morality can be justified from an\nextra-moral standpoint. The \u2018why be moral question\u2019 turns out to be one of those purely philosophical\nquestions which lack a role in practice. Despite denying the availability of any practice-independent\nstandards of moral truth and critique, my account allows for moral criticism and moral progress.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/18403"}, {"person": "Kiran Klaus Patel", "affiliation": "European University Institute", "snippet": "CALLIGARO, Oriane\nNegotiating Europe: EU promotion of Europeanness and non-institutional actors since the\n1950s\nEUI PhD theses, Department of History and Civilization\nDefence date: 8 July 2011, Examining Board: Prof. Kiran Klaus Patel (EUI), Prof. Rainer Baub\u00f6ck (EUI),\nProf. Juan D\u00edez Medrano (University of Barcelona), Prof. Fran\u00e7ois Foret (ULB, Brussels)\nThe concept of Europe is a strong symbolic underpinnings of European integration. Europe functions as\na mobilizing metaphor, a sign of recognition that indicates belonging to a community in formation. At the\ninstitutional level, the mobilization of narratives on Europe participates in the promotion of\nEuropeanness. It aims to render the project of European integration, which is perceived by most\nEuropeans as abstract and technocratic, more concrete, and to arouse feelings of belonging to the\nEuropean Union. Europeanness is understood as a flexible and contingent relation to the category\n\u2018Europe\u2019 and not necessarily as an identification with a fixed substance. The goal of this thesis is to\ndemonstrate that the promotion of Europeanness does not constitute the kind of overarching identity\npolicy that imposes a homogenous interpretation of European identity. Rather, I argue that promoting\nEuropeanness is a process of negotiation in which entrepreneurs of Europeanness within the European\ninstitutions involve non-institutional actors and charge them to invent and communicate representations\nof Europe. Both the negotiation and the hybrid and multilayered representations of Europe that it\nproduces are investigated through four case studies: the academic world and specifically, the\nhistorians, negotiations over European cultural heritage, the second European City of Culture Florence\n1986 and the iconography of the euro.

This thesis suggests that an analytical approach must be taken in studies on\nconsumption paying special attention to the socio-cultural and economic transfers which occur when\ndifferent commodities are introduced to territories with diverse socio-cultural values and identities.\nTherefore one of the key questions of such an analysis is to examine the role of merchants, who have a\nvery important influence on consumer decisions. This thesis describes the new necessities created by\nmerchants, as \u201cvicarious consumers\u201d, inserted in local, national and international market circuits in the\nWestern Mediterranean area. The increase in the consumption of new goods during the eighteenth\ncentury in south-eastern Spain, especially during the second half of the century, entailed changes in\nhousehold economies through some improvements in everyday life. The systematic analysis of probate\ninventories demonstrates potential shifts in the consumption of new durable and semi-durable goods in\nurban and rural families. Certainly, in south-eastern Spain, there was an interest in consuming new,\nexotic and foreign goods. The desires, aspirations and choices of individuals are demonstrated to have\nbeen inspired by a global movement, in which human and material capital circulated trans-continentally,\nshifting the patterns of consumption of societies - whose values and traditions were challenged by the\nacquisition of new material goods. I will not simply analyse those relevant theories applied to material\nculture studies related to Occidental or Oriental societies, such as the \u201cindustrious revolution\u201d or\n\u201ctrickle-down\u201d approaches (which have been applied mostly in developed economies to explain stages\nprior to the Industrial Revolution process). Instead, by observing a southern European society, such as\nSpain, where the industrialization process was slower than that in Anglo-Saxon territories, we may\ndetermine whether both theories occurred simultaneously or separately; identify what the\nsocio-economic forces and agents that prompted the stimulus for new consumer aspirations were; and\nunderstand the cultural consequences that the new modern consumerism brought about.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/18400"}, {"person": "Jan W. van Deth", "affiliation": "University of Mannheim", "snippet": "PETERS, Yvette\nPatterns of Change.

Trechsel, European University\nInstitute (Supervisor) Prof. Peter Mair, European University Institute Prof. Russell J. Dalton, University\nof California at Irvine Prof. Jan W. van Deth, University of Mannheim\nThis thesis aims to explain levels and changes in levels of political participation through institutions and\ninstitutional change. Three general trends have been distinguished; a decline in \u2018representative\u2019\nparticipation, an increase in \u2018extra-representative\u2019 participation, and an increase in \u2018direct\u2019 participation.\nThe notion that these trends are apparent in most established democracies is rather striking and\npuzzling. This study specifically contributes to the debate about the current state and health of\ndemocracy, considering that it is concerned with both system changes in democracies and levels of\npopular participation in these democracies. Changes in these types of participation could partly be\nexplained by changes in the structure of the political system. Although the notion that institutions matter\nin political life is not debated, and their effects have been examined before, the effects of institutions\nhave rarely been examined structurally in large-scale analyses, specifically concerning participation. In\nthis study, three institutional elements which affect the access points and inclusiveness of the political\nsystem are considered: \u2018horizontal\u2019 diffusion of responsibilities (privatisation; the creation of\nnon-majoritarian institutions), \u2018vertical\u2019 diffusion of responsibilities (decentralisation; globalisation) and\n\u2018diagonal\u2019 diffusion of responsibilities (direct democracy institutionalisation). The main aim of this\nresearch is therefore to find to what extent changes in the political system influence levels of different\nforms of political participation, over time and across space. The study finds that, generally,\nrepresentative participation seems to be negatively affected by privatisation, non-majoritarian\ninstitutions, globalisation, and the institutionalisation of referendums, with unclear results regarding the\nimpact of decentralisation. Extrarepresentative participation is generally positively influenced by\nprivatisation, nonmajoritarian institutions, decentralisation, and globalisation, while there are some\nmixed results concerning the influence of the institutionalisation of referendums.

Then, using strategic interaction analysis and conceptual\nexperiments, I propose a number of hypotheses in order to account for the changes in European\nshipbuilding policy over time. European legislation on state aid to shipbuilding is operationalised in the\nqualitative index as the dependent variable. The independent variables include the international market,\nthe number of European member states, international agreements and political decision-making rules.\nAfter the conceptual experiments, methodologically, I apply comparative statics to empirically assess\nwhether or not the explanatory variables have an impact on the output of European shipbuilding policy.\nThe empirical results indicate that international agreements and decision-making rules may lead to\nchanges in European shipbuilding policy. Furthermore, I extend the argument to another industrial\nsector, the European aerospace industry, based on the most similar case selection. However, evidence\nshows that international competition leads to an increase in R&D expenditure in aerospace, while\ninternational agreements merely play a marginal role.

Its aim is twofold: on the one hand to elucidate the mechanisms of caste in social\nlife and in particular, to analyse how ex-untouchables negotiate caste stigma, and on the other, to\nexplore the caste, gender, and youth dimensions of the Ravidassia community in Catalonia, Spain. This\nstudy is comparative in nature, discussing caste, the management of caste stigma, and the Ravidassia\nsociocultural/religious movement in the Punjab, India and Catalonia, Spain. The Ravidassia community\nis an interesting case study for the study of caste, because the Ravidassias are the most important\nformer untouchable group demographically in both the Punjab and in the diaspora. They have also\nbecome in the postwar period one of India\u00b4s most economically and socially assertive \u00b4Scheduled\nCaste\u00b4 or SC caste groups, an assertion which is articulated symbolically in the field of religion. The\nRavidassias are thus an excellent example of a transnational group whose diaspora status is playing a\nkey role in changing the caste status quo in their native Punjab. In focusing on the individual experience\nof caste stigma, this thesis seeks to highlight an aspect of caste discrimination that is frequently\noverlooked in debates on \u00b4casteism\u00b4, and to reveal how Dalits who are now educated and middle-class\nstill struggle with the legacy of untouchability. During the course of my research, a significant portion of\nthe global Ravidassia community, including the Spanish Ravidassia community, chose to break with\nSikhism and form a completely autonomous religious identity. I thus had the privilege to witness a\nprofound identity shift on the part of my interviewees which has seen new forms of caste pride emerge\nthat would have been unthinkable only a generation ago.

Jean-Michel Jacquet, Institut des Hautes Etudes\nInternationales, Geneva\nThe aim of this research is to analyse the interrelationship between Private International Law and\nEuropean Union law in the area of contractual obligations. The Rome I Regulation on the Law\nApplicable to Contractual Obligations is used to delimit the scope of research. The material rules of\nRome I will be discussed in order to demonstrate that the instrument follows the traditional European\nconflict of laws approach without any specific orientation towards internal market objectives. The\ninfluence of Union law upon PIL goes however beyond positive harmonisation, being the codification of\nconflict of law norms on the European level. In the analysis of the effects of Union law upon the conflict\nof law process, a distinction will be drawn between international and =European\u2018 contracts. As regards\ninternational contracts Rome I could be used to establish the international scope of application of\nsecondary Union law when the contract involves a link with a third country. However the legislator\nseems to have given preference to an autonomous approach based upon the object and purpose of the\nrelevant instrument. These directives create nuisance in the conflict of law process and it will be\nproposed to integrate sector specific scope rules in Rome I. With regard to contracts that exclusively\nhave connections with two or more Member States it will be analysed to what extent rules of contract\nlaw are caught by the fundamental freedoms. It will be argued that primary law does not favour ex ante\nthe application of the law of a specific Member State, but may correct the applicable law. Rules that can\nbe set aside by parties by a mere choice of law can however not have the potential effects of hindering\nthe smooth functioning of the internal market. The overall objective of the project is to identify the\nmethodological disharmony between Union law and PIL in the regulation of cross border contracts and\nto propose suggestions to improve their mutual understanding.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/16060"}, {"person": "Joop Hartog", "affiliation": "University of Amsterdam", "snippet": "PROKIC-BREUER, Tijana\nThree Studies on the Sources and Consequences of Social and Cultural Capital among\nEuropean Adolescents\nEUI PhD theses, Department of Political and Social Sciences\nDefence date: 13 June 2011 Examining Board: Prof. Dr. Jaap Dronkers, European University\nInstitute/Univ. Maastricht (Supervisor) Prof. Dr. Joop Hartog, University of Amsterdam (External\nSupervisor) Prof. Dr. Sven Steinmo, European University Institute Prof. Dr. Marc Hooghe, Katholieke\nUniversiteit Leuven\nThis dissertation has two main themes. First, it studies the role of social and cultural capital in\neducational achievement from a comparative perspective. Second, it investigates determinants of\nsocial trust among adolescents, where the theoretical framework combines insights from both political\nsocialization literature and social capital literature. The core of the thesis is three empirical papers. The\nfirst paper is novel in that it explores the relevance of social and cultural capital when measuring\nimprovement in children\u2019s educational achievement in two vastly different societies: Eastern and\nWestern Europe shortly after communism. My explicit question is not if social and cultural capital\ncontribute to educational outcomes, but whether this contribution is the same in different societies. In\nseeking the significance of the role of social and cultural capital, I used data from the Program for\nInternational Students Assessment (PISA) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n(TIMSS) which surveyed 50,000 eighth-grade pupils across Europe. Educational performance is\nmeasured by pupils test scores in mathematics. The second and third papers elaborate what is the\nsecond theme of this thesis: The origins of social trust among adolescents. In order to shed more light\non this issue, I distinguish between two different forms of social trust: generalized trust, which indicates\nhow much adolescents trust other people; and political trust, which indicates the extent to which they\ntrust government-related institutions. I conducted an empirical analysis of the data set from the 1999\nCivic Education Study conducted on 14-year old students across 18 countries. As a result, the second\npaper of this thesis examines the origins of generalized trust among the study\u2019s sample group, whereas\nthe third paper of this thesis explores determinants of political trust among adolescents. Both papers\nexamine the link between socialisation processes within the family and school and their effects on the\ndevelopment of generalized and political trust. In addition, they utilize institutional theories on the\ndevelopment of social trust, and test the proposition that the quality of governmental functioning affects\ndevelopment of generalized and political trust of citizens.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/18617"}, {"person": "Christian Dustmann", "affiliation": "University College London", "snippet": "GO\u00d1I-PACCHIONI, Edwin Antonio\nEssays on Labor and Development Economics\nEUI PhD theses, Department of Economics\nDefence date: 3 June 2011, Examining Board: Prof. Massimiliano Marcellino, EUI, Supervisor Prof.\nLuigi Guiso, EUI Prof. Christian Dustmann, University College London Dr. William Maloney, The World\nBank\nThis work comprises four essays in two related areas: labor and development economics. On the labor\nside, two essays study (i) the effects of sizeable policy reforms over labor informality and (ii) the relation\nbetween productivity and wages in a context of substantial informality and high turnover rates. On the\ndevelopment side, two essays provide a comparison between developed and developing countries in\nthe following aspects: (iii) the degree of complementarity of production factors and their capacity to\ntranslate R&D investments into economic growth and (iv) the effects of fiscal redistribution over income\ninequality. Within the context of Latin America - the most income-unequal and labor-informal region in\nthe world - this work intends to augment the understanding of the behavior, dynamics, interactions and\ncontributions of productive factors (labor and innovative capital) and the effects that policies aimed at\nformalizing labor, innovating capital or redistributing factors retributions may have. The study applies\nrecent measurement techniques and exploits rich novel datasets which combined with reformulated\nmodels help us to propose alternative appealing explanations. Lessons learnt from these four essays\nsuggest that (i) job dynamics play a fundamental role in the success (or failure) of policies aimed at\npromoting labor formality. Against the conventional wisdom, we contend that reductions in hiring rather\nthan increases in separation rates are the main determinants of informality increases following\nprotectionist policies. (ii) Job dynamics also play a differentiating role in the determination of\nwage-productivity elasticities and income risk (with new hires reacting more than incumbents). (iii) Yet,\nreturns of labor and physical capital are constant across countries and periods regardless the stage of\ndevelopment whereas they exhibit an inverted U shape for technological capital (this is, highest returns\nobserved for mid developed cases). (iv) Comparable private returns of productive factors are mirrored\nin comparable market income inequality measures observed across some developed and developing\nregions. However, while in Europe fiscal redistribution helps to achieve better distributed disposable\nincome, in Latin America fiscal redistribution has meager or even countervailing effects.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/17734"}, {"person": "Stein Kuhnle", "affiliation": "University of Bergen", "snippet": "B\u00d8LSTAD, J\u00f8rgen\nPrinciples, Interests and Beliefs: Public opinion on international aid\nEUI PhD theses, Department of Political and Social Sciences\nDefence date: 15 July 2011, Examining Board: Professor Mark N.

And are people in donor\ncountries less supportive of the idea of aid than those in recipient countries? These are the primary\nquestions motivating this thesis, and the results can be summarized by four main findings. One is that\nthe level of economic development, which determines a country\u2019s status as a potential aid donor, has a\nstrong influence on support for aid, as citizens of more developed countries are considerably less in\nfavor of increasing aid than others are. The second finding is that, among donor countries, the level of\ndevelopment is positively related to several forms of opposition to the donation of aid. This appears\npartly due to the fact that more developed countries have donated more aid, for a longer period.\nRespondents in countries that donate more are more likely to find current levels of international aid\nsufficient, and this may explain part of the between-country differences. In other words, people in donor\ncountries may find the extent of international aid satisfactory at lower levels than those in other\ncountries. Most notably, however, people in more developed countries are more likely to state\ndisinterest as a reason for not supporting aid, and this reason is the only one that has a clear impact on\naggregate levels of support. There is also some evidence that greater donations increase skepticism\nregarding the impact of aid, but it is not clear that this affects aggregate support. Furthermore, the third\nfinding is that individual beliefs regarding the impact of aid are endogenous to support for aid. While\nsuch beliefs appear to influence the support for aid at the individual level, there is also a significant\neffect of support on the beliefs themselves. The fourth finding is that the negative relationship between\neconomic development and support holds for all but the very least developed countries of the world. It\nappears that respondents in the latter countries are living under such conditions they lack the critical\nopinions typically found in more developed countries, making it hard to compare them to those from\nmore developed countries.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/1814/18401"}]}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "development cooperation.

This amendment seeks to operationalise a component of our new author guidelines, according to which &#39;EJLS strongly encourages authors to cite early career researchers and to reflect regional, gender, and linguistic diversity in their citations&#39;.

All environmental damage can result in material financial risks, come it from carbon emissions or from any other kind of environmental threat to the planet\u2019s land, air, waters or biodiversity. However, risk assessment and management of all environmental risks is a more complex task than the already challenging endeavour of understanding and dealing with climate risks. For example, the tools used to minimize one kind of environmental risk may have the side-effect of exacerbating climate risk or a different kind of environment risk. See, for example, the discussion about the trade-off between reversing environmental damage and using land to build wind farms and other renewable projects, in the European Union, or the concerns about the environmental damage caused by mining the raw materials used in the manufacturing of electric vehicles\u2019 batteries, as well as the disposal of those batteries.

This has been possible by the generous contributions of EU citizens towards international development cooperation. This book emerges more specifically from the EU\u2019s Aid to Uprooted People (AUP) regional facility which has been the main vehicle of assistance to housing in Sri Lanka since 2006. In the last 12 years, the EU has committed EUR 64 million on the highly successful homeowner-driven approach in Sri Lanka alone. I would like to congratulate the implementing organisations that have been involved in cooperating with the EU in making the best of people\u2019s contributions to their own reconstruction and development. This publication hence documents perspectives of the processes and the challenges faced along the way not only in Sri Lanka, but in various South Asian countries and others. But it is fitting that a review of the owner-driven approach and of the people\u2019s process highlights Sri Lanka as the focal case study for being at its origin. UN-Habitat is grateful to our funding partners \u2014 the EU, the government of Australia, the government of Switzerland and the Government of India (GoI) \u2014 who have supported the principles of owner-driven housing in Sri Lanka in recent years.", "published_on": "2018-12-05", "added_on": "2019-07-23", "document_url":

The impacts of the EU\u2019s anti-trust enforcement and state aid control on the other hand, are not statistically significant.

Residential properties represent the most significant component of households' expenses and, at the same time, their most valuable assets.

Among their professional uses, they serve, for example, to monitor macroeconomic imbalances and risk exposure of the financial sector. This handbook provides, for the first time, comprehensive guidelines for the compilation of RPPIs and explains in depth the methods and best practices used to calculate an RPPI.

OMC is then\nevaluated as positive only when authors believe that soft law can contribute to\ndemocratisation and participation. She also points out that there is no consensus on the\nfact that OMC would lead to policy change. However, most critical accounts in the literature\nfocus on procedure. From this perspective, the intended learning processes do not take\nplace. This is associated with the choice of \u2018good practices\u2019 and indicators, too much\ninformation and documents, with too little time for discussion, language barriers, reports\nrather than strategic plans, institutional differences between states, etc. A lack of\nincorporation in existing policy procedures and a lack of political will to implement the\nOMCs is also ascertained. 649 Moreover, although the OMC was introduced to help cure the\ndemocratic deficit of the EU, its legitimacy is questioned. Authors who question the\nlegitimacy focus their criticism on a lack of direct participation instead of representation.\nMany scholars perceive a lack of openness in the OMC process which resembles deliberation\nbetween elites for elites in which parliaments, social partners and NGOs are hardly involved\nand political alternatives are not discussed. This lack of transparency leads to a real\ndemocratic deficit. Thus, the ambition of OMC to be more democratic than \u2018hard\u2019\ngovernance processes is an illusion. 650"}, {"person": "Sigrid Van der Auwera", "affiliation": "University of Antwerp", "snippet": "Professor Annick Schramme and Sigrid Van der Auwera of the University of Antwerp\ncontribute to the analysis of the implementation of the UNESCO Convention in the area of\ninternal policies of the European Union with as special focus on linguistic diversity."}, {"person": "Lucia Bellucci", "affiliation": "University of Milan", "snippet": "Lucia Bellucci is a Senior Lecturer at the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, Law School.

Whether authors do or do not believe\nin OMC depends inter alia on their appreciation of soft law more generally. OMC is then\nevaluated as positive only when authors believe that soft law can contribute to\ndemocratisation and participation. She also points out that there is no consensus on the\nfact that OMC would lead to policy change. However, most critical accounts in the literature\nfocus on procedure. From this perspective, the intended learning processes do not take\nplace. This is associated with the choice of \u2018good practices\u2019 and indicators, too much\ninformation and documents, with too little time for discussion, language barriers, reports\nrather than strategic plans, institutional differences between states, etc. A lack of\nincorporation in existing policy procedures and a lack of political will to implement the\nOMCs is also ascertained. 649 Moreover, although the OMC was introduced to help cure the\ndemocratic deficit of the EU, its legitimacy is questioned. Authors who question the\nlegitimacy focus their criticism on a lack of direct participation instead of representation.\nMany scholars perceive a lack of openness in the OMC process which resembles deliberation\nbetween elites for elites in which parliaments, social partners and NGOs are hardly involved\nand political alternatives are not discussed. This lack of transparency leads to a real\ndemocratic deficit. Thus, the ambition of OMC to be more democratic than \u2018hard\u2019\ngovernance processes is an illusion. 650"}, {"person": "Sigrid van der Auwera", "affiliation": "University of Antwerp", "snippet": "Professor Annick Schramme and Sigrid Van der Auwera of the University of Antwerp\ncontribute to the analysis of the implementation of the UNESCO Convention in the area of\ninternal policies of the European Union with as special focus on linguistic diversity."}, {"person": "Sigrid Van der Auwera", "affiliation": "University of Antwerp", "snippet": "Sigrid Van der Auwera is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Antwerp.

The analyses carried out in the thesis\u2019 Parts I-III compare different opinions\nabout children\u2019s media consumption on a synchronic as well as a diachronic level.

On the synchronic level, the thesis demonstrates how different views of children, childhood and\nmedia have existed side by side, and that large parts of debates about children\u2019s media consumption have\ninvolved arguments about not only one, but numerous media at the time. Via the diachronic comparison\nit is shown how continuity and break in definitions of (in)appropriate media for children have depended\non, in particular, the professional background of the debaters, socio-cultural processes in Scandinavia and\ninfluences from international trends.

This thesis analyses whether human security may provide\ntools for an expansive and integrated legal interpretation of international human rights, state and non-state\nobligations in the context of structural vulnerability; and whether a gendered and human rights-based\napproach can more accurately define the scope of human security and the types of violence and deprivation\nit considers.

The significance of viewing the internal bodies of legislatures as mega-seats\nis that they are conceived as part of the democratic delegation chain. Consequently, such an approach adds\na political bargaining dimension to the allocation of mega-seats. During the internal organization process\nof the legislature, plenary legislators become principals, who delegate power to internal bodies, mainly to\nenhance labor division, tackle information asymmetries, and channel party demands. This thesis examines\nthe process of payoff distribution in legislatures, using an original dataset containing 350 parties, in 12\nWestern European parliamentary democracies. The analysis is carried out at the party level as well as at\nthe legislature level. Moreover, I conduct two case studies - Portugal and the United Kingdom - to further\ndisentangle the causal mechanisms used to explain mega-seats allocation in parliamentary democracies. The\nempirical analysis starts with an examination of whether the division of payoffs (i.e. mega-seats) follows a\nproportionality logic. The proportionality assumption is borrowed from coalition studies, which have long\nestablished that institutional payoffs are distributed in a 1:1 proportionality. Using a new index to gauge\ndisproportionality in the allocation of legislative mega-seats, the first finding of this thesis is that mega-seats\nallocation in parliamentary democracies is not proportional. Subsequently, I adduce a model that explains\nthis counterintuitive finding at the party and legislature levels. The second main finding is that a party\u2019s\ndegree of disproportionality is a function of its power. Parties are conceived as having a number of resources\nto spend on mega-seats distribution. The way they spend these resources is constrained by the existence of\nproportionality protection rules within an institution and incentivized by the value of the payoff. Regarding\nthe former, I find that rules matter in protecting proportionality whilst for the latter I find that the amount\nof resources parties are willing to spend on a mega-seat depends on the mega-seat\u2019s power. Finally, the third\nmain finding is that, at the aggregate level, the overall power of the legislative branch vis-\u00e0-vis the executive\nbranch is important in determining the degree of disproportionality. Powerful legislatures tend to be more\ndisproportional, as executive members seek control of its internal bodies.\nExamining Board: Professor Stefano Bartolini, EUI (Supervisor) Professor Mark N.

The conclusions\nshow that RIAs\u2019 legal frameworks can facilitate effective translation of sustainable development goals into\nconcrete norms and policies, bridging the divide between a multilateral system of standard setting with low\nimplementation power, and national states with weakened capacity to deal independently with these issues.\nThe RIAs studied have been developing procedural innovations such as \u2018impact assessment\u2019 instruments, and\nsubstantive innovations, such as regional development funds aimed at promoting social cohesion internally,\nand trade instruments that integrate development concerns in their external relations, such as preferential\ntrade systems (GSP) linked to socio-environmental issues and trade agreements that include \u2018trade and\nsustainable development\u2019 chapters. It also provides evidence that, despite their institutional differences, the\ndevelopment of sustainable development laws and policies within the EU has followed a path that can provide\nvaluable insights for MERCOSUR. Finally, the thesis argues that, despite the tensions that might arise between\nthe implementation of these regional measures and the multilateral trade system rules, regional action might\nbe a way to cope with the difficulty of reaching a global agreement while also reflecting more adequately local\nconcerns.

Knowing\nonly which party a legislator belongs to and how the majority of that party voted allows for the identification,\nwith extremely high levels of accuracy, how said legislator actually voted.

Further, most work ignores the most basic explanation of why legislators\nvote the way they do: Their policy preferences.

Applying this logic to parliaments at either extreme\nof the spectrum of parliamentary institutionalisation, it is shown that there is little evidence that legislators\nare compelled to act in ways they do not want. Rather, what is found is that they recognise the value of party\nvoting unity and can overcome the temptation to free-ride on their co-partisans.

It describes the organisation and operation of private mechanisms employed to enforce\ntransnational private regulation in these areas, assesses the interplay between these private mechanisms and\npublic enforcement, and identifies the institutional factors that enable this interplay. On the basis of the findings\nof these two case studies, the study argues that public and private enforcement mechanisms of transnational\nprivate regulation operate principally as complementary means. The concept of complementarity denotes\nthe combination of different mechanisms and activities with the purpose of enhancing regulatory outcomes.\nThis can be achieved either by reinforcing the operation and effects of other mechanisms and activities or by\ncompensating for their deficiencies. As the case studies demonstrate, public enforcement action, or the latent\nthreat thereof, may effectively bolster the capacity of private mechanisms to attain rule compliance. At the\nsame time, however, effective private enforcement mechanisms enable public enforcers to economize on the\ndeployment of scarce enforcement resources. Several preconditions and institutional settings apply to enable\nforms of public-private complementarity. First, there should be a substantive overlap between the objectives\nand standards of public and private regulation. Second, the institutional design of public enforcement should\nenable public authorities exercising administrative enforcement powers to coordinate their activities with\nprivate mechanisms.

This thesis explores the implications of this development for public\ninternational law, which itself has grown and undergone structural changes since the end of the Second World\nWar. The number of actors has grown, the place of the individual has been enhanced and efforts have been\nmade towards the development of normative hierarchy and in the views of some even constitutionalisation.\nYet the PRC has retained an outlook firmly rooted in the concept of state sovereignty, emphasising noninterference\nand equality of states. This approach stems from the history of China\u2019s encounter with the\ninternational legal order in the nineteenth century, when its own sinocentric world order fell victim to its\nviolent encounter with western international law. The current international legal order still retains traces of\nthe legacy of imperialism, although international law has also served as a vehicle for the realisation of the\nhumanitarian ideals of its practitioners and participants. In China\u2019s sovereigntist approach to international\nlaw, the rhetoric and the interests of the developing world play a major role, as China tries to combine the\nsometimes contradictory roles of a \u2018responsible great power\u2019 on the one hand, and leading developing nation\non the other. This thesis analyses its practice in international human rights law, the law of armed conflict,\ninternational criminal law, and various areas related to international peace and security, at normative levels\nfrom general political and diplomatic discourse to the acceptance and interpretation of positive law. This\nanalysis demonstrates that China brings a welcome alternative voice to a still western-centric international\nlegal system. Its defensive adherence to sovereignty, however, creates the risk of normative erosion or dilution\nin various areas in which it claims to have accepted existing international norms. China is not yet a creator of\nnew norms, but has grown very adept at modifying and reshaping existing norms, both legal and societal, to\nbring them more in line with its preferences.

To explore this argument, the dissertation examines\ntax policy-making in four small states in the period 1980-2010, namely New Zealand, Ireland, Norway and\nDenmark. The comparison of both similar cases with different outcomes and different cases with similar\noutcomes - that is, a \u201cmixed systems design\u201d - allows us to evaluate a set of explanations for neoliberal reform.\nBased on official documents, secondary literature and more than 70 interviews with policy-making elites,\nthe analysis combines comparative analysis, process-tracing and counterfactual reasoning. The dissertation\nfinds that neoliberal tax policies were adopted in some countries (New Zealand and Norway) and not in\nothers (Ireland and Denmark) because of the varying entrenchment of the economics profession within\nthe state. Where economists obtained a prominent position in the state during the Keynesian era, finance\nbureaucracies were highly receptive to the neoclassical ideas that spread within the economics discipline in\nthe 1970s and 80s. Where the position of economists was weak or fragmented, neoclassical thinking did not\nbreak through. The position of neoclassical economists in the bureaucracy had a profound impact on policymaking\nnot only because it determined what ideas were present, but also because the specific expertise\nand behavioural norms of neoclassical economists strengthened their influence vis-\u00e0-vis politicians in the\nformulation of policy.

In the first chapter I am\ninterested in optimal targeting in networks. In particular, I analyze what happens when two opposing lobby\ngroups consider the politician not only as an individual, but as part of a network, who influences other\npoliticians. I model the network structure explicitly and allow for heterogeneous politicians, that is politicians\ncan be in favour of one of the lobby groups or neutral. The optimal targeting strategy depends on how much\npoliticians influence each other, the magnitude of their bias, their centrality in the network and what bias\nthe politicians connected to them have. In the second chapter, we build a theory that connects differences\nin workers\u2019 social networks to disparities in their labour market performance. A worker with more friends,\nthat is someone with more network links (higher degree), has better access to information. A worker whose\nfriends are friends among each other (higher clustering coefficient) faces a higher level of peer pressure.\nBoth access to information and peer pressure affect performance on the job. Our model allows us to rank\ndifferent networks in terms of job performance. We then proceed to show that men\u2019s and women\u2019s networks\ndiffer. Men have a higher degree than women, but women have a higher clustering coefficient. These network\ndisparities translate into differences in performance as well as wages, thereby offering a novel explanation for\nthe gender wage gap. The third chapter offers a novel explanation for differences in the integration experience\nof immigrant communities in host societies through a model which emphasises the role of group leaders.\nWe present a model of integration with distinct channels for social influence and skills acquisition and with\na role for group leaders that benefit from their groups maintaining a distinct identity.

At the same time, there is a growing recognition that\nsuch justice includes, together with the need to ensure that appropriate reparation is provided to victims,\nthe criminal accountability of those responsible for the most serious crimes. This thesis argues that there\nis an intrinsic relationship between these two emerging values. In particular, it demonstrates that a right to\njustice, understood as the right to the determination of the individual criminal responsibility of wrongdoers,\nis emerging under international law as an imperative remedy for victims of gross human rights violations\nand international crimes, alongside more traditional forms of reparation. The development of victims\u2019 right\nto justice invites a reconsideration of the role and the rights of victims in criminal proceedings. It is argued\nthat if victims have a right to the prosecution of human rights offenders as an integral component of their\nright to remedy, it is legitimate to assert that they should also be granted corresponding procedural rights\nin the criminal process. Through an extensive review of international legal instruments and practice and a\ncomparative analysis of domestic criminal justice systems, this study demonstrates that the role of victims and\nthe rights they possess in criminal proceedings have considerably expanded during the past three decades.\nThe most significant development can be found in the law and practice of international and internationalized\ncriminal tribunals, where procedures have been introduced aimed at enabling victims to participate in the\nproceedings. The incorporation of a regime of victim redress within the framework of international criminal\ntribunals not only represents an extension of the mandate of international criminal justice but also confirms\na shift in the way in which redress is conceptualised at the international level.\nExamining Board: Professor Francesco Francioni, EUI, Supervisor Professor Nehal Bhuta, EUI Professor\nMicaela Frulli, University of Florence Judge Sylvia Steiner, International Criminal Court.

The significance of viewing the internal bodies of legislatures as mega-seats\nis that they are conceived as part of the democratic delegation chain. Consequently, such an approach adds\na political bargaining dimension to the allocation of mega-seats. During the internal organization process\nof the legislature, plenary legislators become principals, who delegate power to internal bodies, mainly to\nenhance labor division, tackle information asymmetries, and channel party demands. This thesis examines\nthe process of payoff distribution in legislatures, using an original dataset containing 350 parties, in 12\nWestern European parliamentary democracies. The analysis is carried out at the party level as well as at\nthe legislature level. Moreover, I conduct two case studies - Portugal and the United Kingdom - to further\ndisentangle the causal mechanisms used to explain mega-seats allocation in parliamentary democracies. The\nempirical analysis starts with an examination of whether the division of payoffs (i.e. mega-seats) follows a\nproportionality logic. The proportionality assumption is borrowed from coalition studies, which have long\nestablished that institutional payoffs are distributed in a 1:1 proportionality. Using a new index to gauge\ndisproportionality in the allocation of legislative mega-seats, the first finding of this thesis is that mega-seats\nallocation in parliamentary democracies is not proportional. Subsequently, I adduce a model that explains\nthis counterintuitive finding at the party and legislature levels. The second main finding is that a party\u2019s\ndegree of disproportionality is a function of its power. Parties are conceived as having a number of resources\nto spend on mega-seats distribution. The way they spend these resources is constrained by the existence of\nproportionality protection rules within an institution and incentivized by the value of the payoff. Regarding\nthe former, I find that rules matter in protecting proportionality whilst for the latter I find that the amount\nof resources parties are willing to spend on a mega-seat depends on the mega-seat\u2019s power. Finally, the third\nmain finding is that, at the aggregate level, the overall power of the legislative branch vis-\u00e0-vis the executive\nbranch is important in determining the degree of disproportionality.

The first chapter contributes\nto attempts to explain the increase in wage inequality in the U.S. labor market over the past few decades.\nI address the question of how much of this increase can be attributed to factors associated with job-to-job\nmobility. For this purpose, I develop a search model with on-the-job search, anticipation of job destruction,\nand costs to workers when switching jobs. The quantitative analysis involves calibrating the model to match\ncharacteristics of the U.S. labor market in the mid-1980s and the mid-2000s. I find that changes in job-tojob\nmobility have a significant quantitative impact on residual wage inequality. In particular, up to one-half\nof the observed inequality increase is accounted for by the composite effect of three mobility determinants.\nAmong them, the arrival probability of offers on the job plays the leading role, whereas the impact of job\nswitching costs is negligible. In addition, changes in the conditions of job loss amplify the effect of offer\narrivals. In the second chapter, joint work with Arpad Abraham and Fernando Alvarez-Parra, we study the\nimpact of moral hazard in labor contracts on residual wage inequality. The tool of our analysis is a search\nmodel with job-to-job mobility and firm competition for workers, where firms offer long-term contracts\nto risk-averse workers in the presence of repeated moral hazard. For a quantitative analysis, we calibrate\nthe model to match characteristics of the U.S. labor market derived from micro data from the mid-2000s.\nWe find that, on balance, moral hazard increases residual wage inequality by around six percent. The direct\neffect of providing incentives through wage variation accounts for a moderate contribution to inequality\nincrease. In addition, moral hazard affects the wage distribution through several indirect effects, as firms\nadjust the levels of effort implemented and the wage offers made to workers in response to increased effort\ncosts. Through their particularly strong impact on the lower parts of the wage distribution, such effects\ncontribute substantially to the overall rise in inequality. The main reason is that, under moral hazard, low\nwage workers spend significantly less effort.\nExamining Board: Professor \u00c1rp\u00e1d \u00c1brah\u00e1m, European University Institute (Supervisor); Professor\nGueorgui Kambourov, University of Toronto; Professor Ramon Marimon, European University Institute;\nProfessor Josep Pijoan-Mas, CEMFI Madrid.

It describes the organisation and operation of private mechanisms employed to enforce\ntransnational private regulation in these areas, assesses the interplay between these private mechanisms and\npublic enforcement, and identifies the institutional factors that enable this interplay.

The concept of complementarity denotes\nthe combination of different mechanisms and activities with the purpose of enhancing regulatory outcomes.\nThis can be achieved either by reinforcing the operation and effects of other mechanisms and activities or by\ncompensating for their deficiencies. As the case studies demonstrate, public enforcement action, or the latent\nthreat thereof, may effectively bolster the capacity of private mechanisms to attain rule compliance. At the\nsame time, however, effective private enforcement mechanisms enable public enforcers to economize on the\ndeployment of scarce enforcement resources. Several preconditions and institutional settings apply to enable\nforms of public-private complementarity. First, there should be a substantive overlap between the objectives\nand standards of public and private regulation. Second, the institutional design of public enforcement should\nenable public authorities exercising administrative enforcement powers to coordinate their activities with\nprivate mechanisms.

In studies of immigrant integration, however, most analyses\nhave assumed that each state pursues a single and coherent national approach. The aim of this dissertation is\nto challenge this assumption by examining how states pursue integration differently for different categories\nof migrants in post-enlargement Europe. In addition to third country nationals I consider also migrants\nwho have a special cultural and historical bond with their host countries, such as emigrants and descendants\nof emigrants or migrants from the former colonies (co-ethnics), as well as European Union citizens from\nold and new member states. The dissertation builds on empirical evidence collected from 1985 to 2012 at\nnational, regional and city levels in two new countries of immigration in Western Europe: Italy and Spain.\nThe first main finding is that both Italy and Spain chose to distance themselves from the integration policies\nof the more traditional countries of immigration in Europe, which they classify as failures. Instead, the\nnew immigration countries searched for their \u201cown\u201d integration strategy, which they consider a token of\nsovereignty just as much as immigration control. Secondly, both states have introduced different integration\npolicies and integration requirements for different categories of migrants. Rather than pursuing only one\nintegration strategy, the states examined use their resources and abilities to simultaneously pursue different\nintegration strategies for European citizens, co-ethnics and third country nationals. These strategies range\nfrom less to more restrictive (from laissez-faire to mandatory, sanction-based policies, such as the Italian\nintegration agreement and language test). European Union citizens enjoy many rights in when residing in\nother member states without being included in their integration programmes, while third country nationals\nenjoy far fewer rights which they risk to lose if they do not comply with demanding integration programmes.\nCo-ethnics in turn are included in integration programmes but have more rights than other third country\nnationals and, in some areas such as access to citizenship and enrolment in the army, they have even more\nrights than European citizens.

In view of this, the thesis identifies the optimal scope\nof institutional arbitral liability. It is hypothesised that the legal approach to institutional arbitral liability\n(focusing on the explanation of the contractual bonds and institutional activity through the lenses of various\ncontract law theories) alone is insufficient to accommodate all aspects of institutional performance. It is argued\nthat the contractual obligations of institutional arbitration actors should be analysed in view of the social\nand economic goals of institutional regimes. Social goals refer to the questions of authority and legitimacy\nof institutional arbitration (whether in its internal or external aspects), while economic aims refer to the\ntraditional commercial function that arbitral institutions assume in the so-called \u201cmarket\u201d for arbitration\nservices.

With its study of symbolism, this thesis seeks to bring\ntogether the literature on the diplomatic history of the European Communities and the intellectual history\nof the European idea; it also seeks to help historians define the nature of the European Communities and\nassess their place in post-war European history. This thesis is based on the papers of Jean Monnet and Walter\nHallstein, two key figures of the early European Communities, and archival materials from the Historical\nArchives of the European Union in Florence as well as the diplomatic archives of France and Germany,\nBritain and the United States.\nExamining Board: Professor Kiran K.

This, however,\nincreases the likelihood of overlap of the free movement and competition rules, which I analyze in Chapter\n4, arguing that the two sets of rules should not be mutually exclusive but that their limits should be defined\nmore clearly on their own terms. Finally, I look at the interaction between free movement and competition,\nas well as their impact, in three sectors where private regulation is prominent: sports (Chapter 5), legal\nservices (Chapter 6) and standard-setting (Chapter 7).

It was organized by the EUI Working Group on\nEU External Relations Law, under the auspices of Professor Marise Cremona and Professor Petros Mavroidis,\nwith generous support provided by the EUI\u2019s Global Governance Programme and the Academy of European\nLaw. The e-book is divided into four parts. In the introductory part, David Kleimann provides a perspective\non the European Commission\u2019s efforts to implement the \u2018Global Europe\u2019 strategy and outlines the domestic\nand external challenges that EU leaders face in this process. Part II is devoted to crosscutting issues that\ngenerally apply to contemporary PTAs. Against the background of the most recent wave of regional and\ninter-regional economic integration, Petros Mavroidis argues that the relevance of the WTO for international\ntrade liberalization and rule making is fading. Patrick Messerlin, secondly, considers the various domestic\nmotives for the negotiation of PTAs and identifies the actors that play important roles in the political\neconomy processes associated with the negotiation and conclusion of PTAs. Jean-Pierre Chauffour and\nDavid Kleimann, third, examine key economic, institutional, and policy challenges that arise in the course of\nPTA implementation processes in developing countries and derive a number of recommendations that aim\nat more effective and development oriented PTA implementation. Part III then turns to several of topics that\nshed light on specific aspects of EU PTA negotiations and their domestic ratification. For starters, Adrian van\nden Hoven contends that the EU is now moving toward a PTA negotiation approach that is more than ever\ngeared towards the achievement of reciprocity of mutual commitments with partner countries. Maria Joao\nPodgorny, secondly, reflects on the role of the European Parliament in the area of EU trade and investment\npolicy and provides a perspective on the process of inter-institutional cooperation between Parliament, the\nEuropean Commission, and the Council with regard to the ratification of EU PTAs. Elisabeth Roderburg,\nthird, argues the case for deep transatlantic economic integration between the EU and the United States. Jakob\nCornides, fourth, explains how and why the European Commission seeks to export EU intellectual property\nprotection standards to third countries through plurilateral and bilateral trade agreements. In Part IV of this\ne-book, four authors devote particular attention to the question of how the European Union seeks to achieve\nnon-commercial objectives through the negotiation of PTAs. Isabelle Ramdoo and Sanoussi Bilal provide\na critical reflection on the EU\u2019s approach to the negotiation of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA)\nwith African countries and assess the merits of this endeavour for the promotion of economic development\nand regional integration in Africa. Lorand Bartels, secondly, examines how the EU, by means of \u2018human\nrights clauses\u2019 and sustainable development chapters in its PTAs, implements its obligation to ensure that its\nexternal activities respect human rights and pursue the objective of promoting sustainable development.

The significance of viewing the internal bodies of legislatures as mega-seats\nis that they are conceived as part of the democratic delegation chain. Consequently, such an approach adds\na political bargaining dimension to the allocation of mega-seats. During the internal organization process\nof the legislature, plenary legislators become principals, who delegate power to internal bodies, mainly to\nenhance labor division, tackle information asymmetries, and channel party demands. This thesis examines\nthe process of payoff distribution in legislatures, using an original dataset containing 350 parties, in 12\nWestern European parliamentary democracies. The analysis is carried out at the party level as well as at\nthe legislature level. Moreover, I conduct two case studies - Portugal and the United Kingdom - to further\ndisentangle the causal mechanisms used to explain mega-seats allocation in parliamentary democracies. The\nempirical analysis starts with an examination of whether the division of payoffs (i.e. mega-seats) follows a\nproportionality logic. The proportionality assumption is borrowed from coalition studies, which have long\nestablished that institutional payoffs are distributed in a 1:1 proportionality. Using a new index to gauge\ndisproportionality in the allocation of legislative mega-seats, the first finding of this thesis is that mega-seats\nallocation in parliamentary democracies is not proportional. Subsequently, I adduce a model that explains\nthis counterintuitive finding at the party and legislature levels. The second main finding is that a party\u2019s\ndegree of disproportionality is a function of its power. Parties are conceived as having a number of resources\nto spend on mega-seats distribution. The way they spend these resources is constrained by the existence of\nproportionality protection rules within an institution and incentivized by the value of the payoff. Regarding\nthe former, I find that rules matter in protecting proportionality whilst for the latter I find that the amount\nof resources parties are willing to spend on a mega-seat depends on the mega-seat\u2019s power. Finally, the third\nmain finding is that, at the aggregate level, the overall power of the legislative branch vis-\u00e0-vis the executive\nbranch is important in determining the degree of disproportionality.

The argument that I present has two levels. The first level\nconsists of two theoretical claims about exploring the moral subjectivity of the state in International Relations.\nThe first claim is that in order to argue meaningfully about the moral subjectivity of the state one has to take\nseriously the state\u2019s being-in-theworld qua state. By relying on Immanuel Kant\u2019s political philosophy and\npractical metaphysics, I will offer a theory that is applicable when one wishes to conceptualise the state as\nan autonomous entity in its own right, and, subsequently, allows one to argue that all states, despite their\ndifferent prudential and contingent differences and characteristics, are moral agents. The second theoretical\nclaim is that the moral personhood of the state is not in and of itself merely metaphysical \u2013 that it is, in\nfact, something purely intrinsic to the agent. Here I depart from Kant\u2019s original idea of essentialist moral\npersonality of the state, and, in contrast to Kant, argue that the moral subjectivity of the state is always\nreciprocal. Moral subjectivity, therefore, cannot be studied without the concept of moral standing: the agent\u2019s\npositioning among other similar entities. Moral subjectivity proper is then constituted by recognition of\nother similar subjects who consider themselves as moral subjects. Moral subjectivity is always conditional\nand placed under scrutiny by politics of recognition. The second level of the argument maintains that when\none then studies practices of moral subjectivity of the state \u2013 that is, states vis-\u00e0-vis each other in international\nsociety \u2013 it is the recognition of subjectivity that plays a central role in identifying states as moral agents in\nworld affairs. While every state in theory qualifies as a moral person, their moral standing as fully-fledged\nmoral subjects is constantly challenged due to their empirical differences in practice. One such difference\nexplored in this study is the liberal/non-liberal character of the state. In order to make sense of the claims\nof different and sometimes even contradictory moral statuses of different types of empirical states in world\npolitics, I argue that one has to explore the practices of moral subjectivity as well.\nExamining Board: Professor Christian Reus-Smit, University of Queensland (EUI Supervisor) Professor\nKimberly Hutchings, London School of Economics and Political Science Professor Mervyn Frost, King\u2019s\nCollege London Professor Friedrich Kratochwil, Central European University (formerly EUI).

Knowing\nonly which party a legislator belongs to and how the majority of that party voted allows for the identification,\nwith extremely high levels of accuracy, how said legislator actually voted. However, most explanations of why\nthis is the case rests of unsustainable assumptions about the effects of institutions and electoral systems on\nthe behaviour of parliamentarians. Further, most work ignores the most basic explanation of why legislators\nvote the way they do: Their policy preferences. Without first explaining the role they play in legislative\nbehaviour, little else can be explained with confidence. This work first theorises and develops measures of\nhow parliamentarians\u2019 policy preferences lead to incentives for them to vote against their party\u2019s line in floor\nvotes, and then applies them to a series of diverse institutional setups, showing that while parliamentarians\u2019\npreferences may explain significant parts of parliamentary party voting unity, it is also clear that they cannot,\nexcept in rare circumstances, explain all of it. Having shown that preferences cannot explain unity, this work\nthen argues that by analysing MPs\u2019 attitudes to party unity, we can understand why MPs choose to vote\ncontrary to what their preferences alone would predict. Applying this logic to parliaments at either extreme\nof the spectrum of parliamentary institutionalisation, it is shown that there is little evidence that legislators\nare compelled to act in ways they do not want. Rather, what is found is that they recognise the value of party\nvoting unity and can overcome the temptation to free-ride on their co-partisans. Finally, analysing floor\nvotes in the European Parliament, it is shown that what explains defection are the long-term rather than\nshort-term goals of parliamentarians, complementing the previous findings.\nExamining Board: Professor Adrienne H\u00e9ritier, EUI (Supervisor) Professor Stefanie Bailer, ETH Z\u00fcrich\n(External Supervisor) Professor Mark Franklin, EUI & MIT Professor Simon Hix, London School of\nEconomics and Political Science.

The fundamental nature of this question requires a structuring\nand theorization of the interaction between religion and public education in two interrelated theoretical\nsteps.

The argument that I present has two levels. The first level\nconsists of two theoretical claims about exploring the moral subjectivity of the state in International Relations.\nThe first claim is that in order to argue meaningfully about the moral subjectivity of the state one has to take\nseriously the state\u2019s being-in-theworld qua state. By relying on Immanuel Kant\u2019s political philosophy and\npractical metaphysics, I will offer a theory that is applicable when one wishes to conceptualise the state as\nan autonomous entity in its own right, and, subsequently, allows one to argue that all states, despite their\ndifferent prudential and contingent differences and characteristics, are moral agents. The second theoretical\nclaim is that the moral personhood of the state is not in and of itself merely metaphysical \u2013 that it is, in\nfact, something purely intrinsic to the agent. Here I depart from Kant\u2019s original idea of essentialist moral\npersonality of the state, and, in contrast to Kant, argue that the moral subjectivity of the state is always\nreciprocal. Moral subjectivity, therefore, cannot be studied without the concept of moral standing: the agent\u2019s\npositioning among other similar entities. Moral subjectivity proper is then constituted by recognition of\nother similar subjects who consider themselves as moral subjects. Moral subjectivity is always conditional\nand placed under scrutiny by politics of recognition. The second level of the argument maintains that when\none then studies practices of moral subjectivity of the state \u2013 that is, states vis-\u00e0-vis each other in international\nsociety \u2013 it is the recognition of subjectivity that plays a central role in identifying states as moral agents in\nworld affairs. While every state in theory qualifies as a moral person, their moral standing as fully-fledged\nmoral subjects is constantly challenged due to their empirical differences in practice. One such difference\nexplored in this study is the liberal/non-liberal character of the state.

The significance of viewing the internal bodies of legislatures as mega-seats\nis that they are conceived as part of the democratic delegation chain. Consequently, such an approach adds\na political bargaining dimension to the allocation of mega-seats. During the internal organization process\nof the legislature, plenary legislators become principals, who delegate power to internal bodies, mainly to\nenhance labor division, tackle information asymmetries, and channel party demands. This thesis examines\nthe process of payoff distribution in legislatures, using an original dataset containing 350 parties, in 12\nWestern European parliamentary democracies. The analysis is carried out at the party level as well as at\nthe legislature level. Moreover, I conduct two case studies - Portugal and the United Kingdom - to further\ndisentangle the causal mechanisms used to explain mega-seats allocation in parliamentary democracies. The\nempirical analysis starts with an examination of whether the division of payoffs (i.e. mega-seats) follows a\nproportionality logic. The proportionality assumption is borrowed from coalition studies, which have long\nestablished that institutional payoffs are distributed in a 1:1 proportionality. Using a new index to gauge\ndisproportionality in the allocation of legislative mega-seats, the first finding of this thesis is that mega-seats\nallocation in parliamentary democracies is not proportional. Subsequently, I adduce a model that explains\nthis counterintuitive finding at the party and legislature levels. The second main finding is that a party\u2019s\ndegree of disproportionality is a function of its power. Parties are conceived as having a number of resources\nto spend on mega-seats distribution. The way they spend these resources is constrained by the existence of\nproportionality protection rules within an institution and incentivized by the value of the payoff. Regarding\nthe former, I find that rules matter in protecting proportionality whilst for the latter I find that the amount\nof resources parties are willing to spend on a mega-seat depends on the mega-seat\u2019s power. Finally, the third\nmain finding is that, at the aggregate level, the overall power of the legislative branch vis-\u00e0-vis the executive\nbranch is important in determining the degree of disproportionality.

In this thesis I explore three different set ups which combine a theoretical model and an\nempirical framework to better understand how the wider environment influences behavior and outcomes in\nmarkets. The following three papers focus on applications in the areas of economic growth, labor markets\nand health economics. The global network position of an economy has a profound impact on economic\ngrowth. A new measure of economic integration is implemented to characterize economic globalization.\nDescriptive statistics suggest that this new methodology offers superior possibilities to capture global trends\nwhich reflect patterns of interactions between firms and countries. Findings from a modified empirical\ngrowth model suggest that a more central global network position fosters economic growth. Robustness\nchecks and alternative estimation strategies address issues of endogeneity and reversed causality in a dynamic\npanel framework. Social networks and in particular the interaction between applicants, workers and firms\ninfluence labor market outcomes. The behavior of firms, workers and applicants during the recruitment\nprocess is modeled in a bayesian signaling model which under certain conditions predicts a higher match\nquality between an applicant and a firm if employee referrals were used. Here, the theoretical model pays\nspecial attention to potential incentive problems due to nepotism and favoritism. Empirical results suggest\na higher starting wage and a longer duration of the position as well as a different earnings path for workers\nwho learnt about their job through a social network. Individual behavior in terms of consumption depends\non the health status. The theoretical concept of state dependent utility functions illustrates that changes in\ncircumstances impact individual behavior such that the health status influences the relative composition of\nthe consumption basket over different categories of goods and services. Results from the empirical framework\nsupport this concept and show robust findings for changes in consumption in non durable and semi durable\ngoods which can be linked to the individual health status measured in terms of functional problems to\nactivities of daily living.\nExamining Board: Professor J\u00e9r\u00f4me Adda, European University Institute (Supervisor) Professor Andrea\nMattozzi, European University Instute Uta Sch\u00f6nberg, University College London Professor Andrea\nWeber,Universit\u00e4t Mannheim.

This is true in particular for the EU Treaties. To make sense of\nthese developments, this thesis presents a comprehensive account of foreign policy objectives as a growing\npart of European constitutional law. It grasps these provisions as legal norms, discerns their legal force and\nfunctions, and situates them into the overall legal order of the state, the Union, and the composite \u2018European\nConstitutional Space\u2019. It argues that for comparative constitutional law in general, the codification of foreign\npolicy objectives suggests a step forward in the evolution of the role of the constitution: From limiting public\nauthority to guiding it towards certain goals, both at home and in the world. For the EU in particular, this\nresearch advances a comparative constitutional perspective for the study of EU external relations, and adds\na constitutional dimension to the \u2018normative power\u2019 debate in the study of EU foreign policy. Drawing on\nestablished national doctrines on constitutional objectives from Germany, France and India, the thesis\nelaborates a common vocabulary for understanding foreign policy objectives across different jurisdictions. It\nadapts these findings to the pluralist context of the Union and its Member States, which closely intertwines\nboth legal orders and foreign policies. It reveals that constitutional foreign policy objectives represent norms\nof constitutional rank which commit a polity to an active and \u2018normative\u2019 foreign policy, serving principally\nas an interpretive lens through which public powers can be enlarged. As a feature peculiar to the EU context,\nsuch objectives help to channel the individual ambitions of the Member States through the Union framework\ntowards a more coherent, albeit polyphonic, external action. Furthermore, the project feeds its legal findings\ninto the debate on the EU as an actor in International Relations, drawing on the main IR theories to sharpen\nthe analysis of these norms in inter-institutional struggles as well in long-term processes of identity-shaping,\nlegitimation and socialization.\nExamining Board: Professor Lo\u00efc Azoulai, European University Institute Professor Marise Cremona,\nEuropean University Institute (Supervisor) Professor Christophe Hillion, Leiden University Professor Daniel\nThym, University of Konstanz.

In the first chapter I am\ninterested in optimal targeting in networks. In particular, I analyze what happens when two opposing lobby\ngroups consider the politician not only as an individual, but as part of a network, who influences other\npoliticians. I model the network structure explicitly and allow for heterogeneous politicians, that is politicians\ncan be in favour of one of the lobby groups or neutral. The optimal targeting strategy depends on how much\npoliticians influence each other, the magnitude of their bias, their centrality in the network and what bias\nthe politicians connected to them have. In the second chapter, we build a theory that connects differences\nin workers\u2019 social networks to disparities in their labour market performance. A worker with more friends,\nthat is someone with more network links (higher degree), has better access to information. A worker whose\nfriends are friends among each other (higher clustering coefficient) faces a higher level of peer pressure.\nBoth access to information and peer pressure affect performance on the job. Our model allows us to rank\ndifferent networks in terms of job performance. We then proceed to show that men\u2019s and women\u2019s networks\ndiffer. Men have a higher degree than women, but women have a higher clustering coefficient. These network\ndisparities translate into differences in performance as well as wages, thereby offering a novel explanation for\nthe gender wage gap. The third chapter offers a novel explanation for differences in the integration experience\nof immigrant communities in host societies through a model which emphasises the role of group leaders.\nWe present a model of integration with distinct channels for social influence and skills acquisition and with\na role for group leaders that benefit from their groups maintaining a distinct identity. In the long run, full\nintegration is achieved only with flexible leaders, which themselves adapt over time. In the presence of rigid\nleaders that adopt an inflexible position, integration can remain incomplete, with integration levels higher\nfor individuals of higher ability.\nExamining Board: Professor Raquel Fernandez, New York University Professor Massimo Morelli, Columbia\nUniversity Professor Fernando Vega-Redondo, Bocconi University Professor Yves Zenou, Stockholm\nUniversity.

However, this connection has seldom been explored at a deeper level that\ntranscends human rights as discourse or token. This thesis analyses whether human security may provide\ntools for an expansive and integrated legal interpretation of international human rights, state and non-state\nobligations in the context of structural vulnerability; and whether a gendered and human rights-based\napproach can more accurately define the scope of human security and the types of violence and deprivation\nit considers.

The thesis\nargues that political elites staged the early European Communities - the 1952 ECSC as well as the 1958 EEC\nand Euratom - as the representation of a united Europe and so tied them to a vision with much momentum\nin post-war Europe. This symbolic role of the Communities transcended their technocratic set-up and their\nnarrow economic policies: it made them distinctive among the many post-war European organizations.\nEmpirically, this thesis focuses, in separate parts, on three settings where the Communities were staged as\nthe united Europe: the Communities\u2019 parliamentary assem-blies (first part), the Communities\u2019 diplomatic\nactivities (second part), and the Communities\u2019 polycentric seating arrangements (third part). This thesis deals\nwith a wide array of actors who, for different reasons, participated, actively or tacitly, in the staging of the\nCommunities: the news media and occasionally also civil society actors, governments and administrations,\nparties and parliaments across the original six member states as well as those of the Communities\u2019 external\npartners, Britain and the United States. Conceptually, this thesis presents a cultural history approach to\nEuropean integration. It aligns itself with a new strand of research in European integration history that\naims to go beyond the much-advanced diplomatic history of the European Communities and to add to it\nan interest in discourses, identities, and symbols. With its study of symbolism, this thesis seeks to bring\ntogether the literature on the diplomatic history of the European Communities and the intellectual history\nof the European idea; it also seeks to help historians define the nature of the European Communities and\nassess their place in post-war European history.

The notion of credit markets as a frictionsless veil\nover real economic activity has proven to be unfruitful with respect to many questions of economic interest.\nTo name only a few examples, in the absence of financial frictions there is no difference between internal and\nexternalfinancing, no trade-off between equity and debt, and there is no reason for banks to exist. In order to\ncorrectly identify and address the policy needs which might arise from credit market failure, we need to learn\nmore about the fundamental conditions which give rise to the financial contracts and institutions observed\nin reality. The first chapter of this thesis focuses on the phenomenon of the publicly traded firm with its\nseparation of ownership and control. I show how a time-varying misalignment of incentives of firm managers\nand investors can have important consequences for aggregate business fluctuations. In particular, a rise in\nidiosyncratic firm-level uncertainty may result in an economy-wide increase in the default rate on corporate\nbonds together with a drop in measured firm productivity and output. Bank transparency is the topic of the\nsecond chapter. In this model, banks are special because the product they are selling is superior information\nabout investment opportunities. Intransparent balance sheets turn this public good into a marketable private\ncommodity. In the absence of policy intervention, bank competition results in complete bank opacity and\na high degree of aggregate uncertainty for households. Mandatory disclosure rules can improve upon the\nmarket outcome. The third chapter is joint work with David Strauss. It focuses on the consequences of credit\nmarket failure for development and growth. We show that capital market imperfections may give rise to a\npoverty trap associated with permanent productivity differences across countries.

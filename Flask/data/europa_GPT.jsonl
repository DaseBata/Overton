An analysis of RIS3 indicators suggests that a proper \u2018priority taxonomy\u2019 is lacking, raising doubts whether countries and regions are truly selective in setting priorities, whether they align the priority setting process between the national and regional level and whether the resulting set of priorities is really a factor of differentiation for countries and re...", "published_on": "2021-09-24", "added_on": "2021-09-27", "document_url": "https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d25406cc-1f41-11ec-bd8e-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=d25406cc-1f41-11ec-bd8e-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/c819a397774c5d3fd3b77fcbbd2741e1.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/c819a397774c5d3fd3b77fcbbd2741e1.png", "topics": ["Human activities", "Cognition", "Monitoring and evaluation", "Data analysis", "Economics", "GUID Partition Table", "Entrepreneurship", "Strategy", "Policy", "European Union", "Evaluation", "Research", "Innovation", "Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development", "Governance", "Multi-level governance", "Correlation and dependence", "Technology", "Technology roadmap", "European Commission", "Research and development", "Education", "Top-down and bottom-up design", "Branches of science", "Non-governmental organization", "Database", "Information", "Goal", "Triple helix model of innovation", "Analysis", "Data", "Science and technology", "Science", "Communication"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["education>school", "education>school>higher education", "economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>business information", "economy, business and finance>business information>strategy and marketing", "politics", "education", "science and technology", "education>school>higher education>university", "education>school>further education", "economy, business and finance>business information>strategy and marketing>research and development", "politics>government"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["Catalogue number KJ-09-21-288-EN-N", "10.2760/711198", "9789276403180", "ISSN"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2776/617294", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2760/073148", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2307/2601030", "title": "The Effects of Government-Industry R&D Programs on Private R&D: The Case of the Small Business Innovation Research Program", "journal": "The RAND Journal of Economics", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.2777/36546", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2791/984739", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1080/09654313.2016.1176126", "title": "On the policy space of smart specialization strategies", "journal": "European Planning Studies", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1080/09654313.2016.1156058", "title": "From theory to practice in smart specialization strategy: emerging limits and possible future trajectories", "journal": "European Planning Studies", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1007/s10961-015-9433-8", "title": "Targeted innovation policy and practice intelligence (TIP2E): concepts and implications for theory, policy and practice", "journal": "The Journal of Technology Transfer", "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC"}, {"doi": "10.1080/09654313.2014.1003036", "title": "Efforts to Implement Smart Specialization in Practice\u2014Leading Unlike Horses to the Water", "journal": "European Planning Studies", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1080/21681376.2015.1085329", "title": "Delivering smart specialization in peripheral regions: the role of Universities", "journal": "Regional Studies, Regional Science", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1111/radm.12309", "title": "Beyond \u2018triple helix\u2019 toward \u2018quadruple helix\u2019 models in regional innovation systems: implications for theory and practice", "journal": "R and D Management", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.respol.2015.11.010", "title": "Measuring technological novelty with patent-based indicators", "journal": "Research Policy", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1257/0002828041301407", "title": "Was Electricity a General Purpose Technology?

To have comparable data, a first intercomparison of ozone measurements has taken place in May 1994 at the JRC Ispra; twelve laboratories from Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Slovenia and Italy have taken advantage of the ERLAP facilities for that exercise. The intercomparison has shown that 13 out of 16 different monitors involved in the exercise measured ozone concentrations in good agreement with the ERLAP standard values. Except for the lowest level (8 ppbv), for which the accuracy is largely influenced by the instrumental noise, all other values were within \u00b1 7% of the standard value.

The main problem is related to wide variations in the quality and accuracy of the in vivo data, in the organisms used, and also in the complexity and poor understanding of the mechanisms involved, especially for longer-term effects. Nevertheless, there have been numerous efforts to develop QSAR models in this field. This paper reviews QSAR models for the mammalian toxicity published in the last ten years.

In summary, 25 different types of nanotechnology applications have been identified and a large variety of different nanomaterials has been encountered, ranging from inorganic and organic nanoparticles to more complex core-shells and nanocomposites. Most of the nanomaterials used in applications for hydraulic fracturing are of inorganic nature. About half of the application types are specific for unconventional reservoirs including tight and ultra-tight gas, shale gas, and coal-bed methane.

The high growth resulting from the ever-increasing pace of ICT-related innovation requires high levels of R&D to be sustained. Indeed, the European ICT sector accounts for over a quarter of overall business expenditure on R&D, which makes it the largest R&D investing sector. A set of EU policy initiatives emphasise the importance of ICT and the underlying R&D for boosting European performance and competiveness. In order to ensure that public policies create the right conditions for sustaining and increasing the support for R&D, an appropriate measuring framework based on the thorough review of the best available methodologies need to be devised.

It calls on the EU to act urgently so that it is ready to drive the new wave (cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things \u2026). It stresses that current supply-focussed policies should be strongly complemented by policies that promote the demand and thus the use of ICT in order to empower users, both individuals and businesses, to leverage economies of scale and scope in the single market and secure Europe's competitiveness.

In this\npaper, Inklaar and Timmer consider the increase in European employment growth during\nthe late 1990s, and examine how much of this can be attributed to business cycles, wage\nmoderation and labour market regulation. Using an industry-panel data set, wage\nmoderation is found to have had only a limited impact. Cyclical factors are found to have\nplayed some role in the rise in employment. In particular, the authors find evidence to\nsuggest that the decline in employment protection may have led to greater volatility in\nemployment, and hence cyclical factors may have played a more significant role in\nincreasing employment than previous studies have indicated. Structural reforms are\nfound to be of less importance in explaining employment growth. If gains in employment\nduring the 1990s are predominantly due to cyclical rather than structural factors, this\nmay have less favourable consequences for employment growth in a future downturn."}, {"person": "Lourens Broersma", "affiliation": "University of Groningen", "snippet": "The aim of this small workshop was to have an open exchange between 12-15\nparticipants coming from academia, government and business on the state of our\nknowledge and experience with structural reforms on markets in the light of recent surge\nin technological progress and diffusion.

One relevant issue in this connection is understanding the likely impact of these technologies on productivity. Indeed, the impacts of earlier introductions of disruptive technology in history \u2013 such as the industrial revolution and the mechanisation of agriculture \u2013 suggest that the automation of existing tasks can produce extraordinary increases in productivity (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2019). To assess the growth potential of this new wave of innovation, in this study we examine the impact of AI technologies on total factor productivity. This involves analysing improvements in productivity by firms who have patented AI technologies. In particular, we exploit a novel dataset of AI patents at firm level, to analyse whether the extent with which firms develop AI technologies positively affects productivity and wages.

A new production revolution, enabled in part by artificial intelligence (AI), is now emerging, bringing a new wave of technologies, but there are widespread fears that these changes also will bring a big rise in unemployment as machines replace human beings in big numbers. History tells us that we should not be afraid of industrial change. AI will take over some tasks, but this will not happen all of a sudden and there will be plenty of work left for humans.

In particular, economic analysis in the context of the so-called endogenous-growth approach (often termed \"new growth theories\") has shifted towards elements such as human capital (education and training) and R&D, both of which could be used to increase knowledge accumulation and technical progress. This paper provides a review of the literature on the impact of ICT on economic growth and productivity. It also provides input to the discussion on extending the neoclassical growth framework to incorporate elements of endogenous growth theories in order to consider the impact of ICT diffusion on growth and productivity. This study gives an overview of the traditional growth accounting framework, rooted in Solow's contributions and its extension, taking into account cases where under-investment in growth-promoting items such as R&D can be detected.

Last year\u2019s turmoil in the financial services industry has pushed the global economy into its worst recession since the 1930s. The response to the downturn vis-\u00e0-vis broadband investment has not been uniform: some countries are increasing their investment in broadband technology while others are cutting funds. Overall, total worldwide Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) spending has sharply decreased over the last two years as a consequence of the economic downturn. The global recession represents both an opportunity and a threat to the development of the ICT sector. Further investment can boost GDP, improve energy efficiency and reduce the cost of moving to renewable energy production systems.

It calls on the EU to act urgently so that it is ready to drive the new wave (cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things \u2026).

A complex and multi-faceted picture regarding prioritisation and implementation of smart specialisation strategies in the EU emerges: Priority areas of S3 strategies in the EU are largely based on objective data-driven identification processes. The EDP processes are appreciated by stakeholders but also illustrate room for improvement regarding continuous dialogue and data analysis on a granular level.

However, we lack the tools to determine which achievements will be attained in the near future. Also, we usually underestimate which various technologies in AI are capable of today. Certainly, the translation from scientific papers and benchmark performance to products is faster in AI than in other non-digital sectors. However, it is often the case that research breakthroughs do not directly translate to a technology that is ready to use in real-world environments. This report constitutes the second edition of a study proposing an example-based methodology to categorise and assess several AI technologies, by mapping them onto Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) (e.g., maturity and availability levels). We first interpret the nine TRLs in the context of AI and identify different categories in AI to which they can be assigned.

Our analysis makes use of such a concept of social institutions but adds a much more comprising list of variables that make up critical social institutions, which guide economic processes and eventually produce particular outcomes.", "published_on": "2020-02-05", "added_on": "2020-02-28", "document_url": "https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/c5720a9c-4909-11ea-b81b-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://op.europa.eu/portal2012-portlet/html/downloadHandler.jsp?identifier=c5720a9c-4909-11ea-b81b-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/45fc7816537dcbee6a71695364dddea4.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/45fc7816537dcbee6a71695364dddea4.png", "topics": ["Institution", "Capital (economics)", "Labour economics", "Gross domestic product", "Economics", "Innovation", "Economic growth", "Productivity", "Human activities", "Business", "Economy", "Capitalism", "Research and development", "European Union", "Eur-Lex", "P-value", "Capital intensity", "Macroeconomics", "Economic development", "Investment", "Growth accounting", "Venture capital", "Workforce productivity", "Research", "Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008", "Business economics", "Statistics", "Categorical variable"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economy", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "science and technology>social sciences>economics", "science and technology>social sciences", "economy, business and finance>business information"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": [], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1177/002795011924700111", "title": "Persistent Productivity Failure in the UK: Is the EU Really to Blame?", "journal": "National Institute Economic Review", "publisher": "SAGE Publications"}, {"doi": "10.1787/5a16beda-en", "title": "Insolvency regimes, zombie firms and capital reallocation", "journal": "OECD Economics Department Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264193307-en", "title": "Supporting Investment in Knowledge Capital, Growth and Innovation", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/5jlwvz0smq45-en", "title": "Links between weak investment and the slowdown in productivity and potential output growth across the OECD", "journal": "OECD Economics Department Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1007/s10272-018-0722-y", "title": "Productivity Growth and International Competitiveness: Does Intangible Capital Matter?", "journal": "Intereconomics", "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC"}, {"doi": "10.1007/s10961-019-09717-0", "title": "The role of R&D and input trade in productivity growth: innovation and technology spillovers", "journal": "The Journal of Technology Transfer", "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC"}, {"doi": "10.1111/j.1540-5982.2008.00467.x", "title": "Trade liberalization and productivity dynamics: evidence from Canada", "journal": "The Canadian Journal of Economics", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1257/jep.26.2.91", "title": "Gains from Trade when Firms Matter", "journal": "Journal of Economic Perspectives", "publisher": "American Economic Association"}, {"doi": "10.1016/0304-3932(88)90168-7", "title": "On the mechanics of economic development", "journal": "Journal of Monetary Economics", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.7208/chicago/9780226613475.003.0006", "title": "AI as the Next GPT", "publisher": "University of Chicago Press"}, {"doi": "10.1007/s10272-011-0387-2", "title": "Intangible capital: the key to growth in Europe", "journal": "Intereconomics", "publisher": "Springer Nature"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.10.009", "title": "Do patent rights matter?

With appropriate policies, the technological advances can continue apace and will translate into productivity growth, so that households can contribute to and benefit from the new goods and services

Special attention is paid within a gravity model framework to the impact of service trade restrictions on both margins of retail trade internationalisation. The use of hurdle models for count data to estimate the determinants of the extensive margin takes into account that there are a lot of zero counts for the number of retail trade firms controlled by a country j in an EU country i. The estimation results for the extensive margin of retail trade FDI activities show that service trade restrictiveness increases the hurdle that at least one firm from country j controls a retail trade firm in country i. Once one firm from country j has been able to jump over this hurdle, the existing service trade restrictions are neither a relevant factor for the number of following firms from country j in that market nor for the average employment and sales of these firms.", "published_on": "2018-11-12", "added_on": "2019-07-23", "document_url": "https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3ade9352-e713-11e8-b690-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://publications.europa.eu/portal2012-portlet/html/downloadHandler.jsp?identifier=3ade9352-e713-11e8-b690-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/5de04d81a8be26b673f27cf653b334d1.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/5de04d81a8be26b673f27cf653b334d1.png", "topics": ["Internationalization", "Overdispersion", "Franchising", "Foreign direct investment", "Market (economics)", "Export", "Retail", "Innovation", "Economies of scale", "Joint venture", "Human activities", "Business", "Economy", "Poisson regression", "Economic equilibrium", "Economics", "Trade", "Strategic alliance", "Profit (economics)", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Business economics", "European Union", "Monopoly", "Target market", "Linear regression", "Negative binomial distribution", "M0 motorway (Hungary)", "Multinational corporation", "Fixed effects model", "Productivity", "Competitive advantage"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "science and technology>social sciences", "science and technology", "science and technology>mathematics", "science and technology>social sciences>economics", "economy, business and finance>economy"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": [], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2760/331386", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1787/eco_studies-v2003-art2-en", "title": "The Influence of Policies on Trade and Foreign Direct Investment", "journal": "OECD Economic Studies", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/16ec6b55-en", "title": "Multinational production and trade in services", "journal": "OECD Trade Policy Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/eco_studies-v2001-art8-en", "title": "Regulatory reform in retail distribution", "journal": "OECD Economic Studies", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/5jrqgvg0dw27-en", "title": "The negative effect of regulatory divergence on foreign direct investment", "journal": "OECD Economics Department Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.jinteco.2011.12.012", "title": "Export Versus FDI and the Communication of Complex Information", "journal": "Journal of International Economics", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.tourman.2016.02.012", "title": "A gravity model of foreign direct investment in the hospitality industry", "journal": "Tourism Management", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.5901/mjss.2014.v5n4p194", "title": "Entry Mode Issues in the Internationalisation of South African Retailing", "journal": "Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences", "publisher": "Walter de Gruyter GmbH"}, {"doi": "10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01256.x", "title": "The Determinants of Foreign Direct Investment in Services", "journal": "The World Economy", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1108/09590550510577138", "title": "Explaining retail offer adaptation through psychic distance", "journal": "International Journal of Retail & Distribution Management", "publisher": "Emerald"}, {"doi": "10.1257/aer.91.3.693", "title": "Estimating The Knowledge-Capital Model of the Multinational Enterprise", "journal": "American Economic Review", "publisher": "American Economic Association"}, {"doi": "10.1111/1467-9396.00359", "title": "Discriminating Among Alternative Theories of the Multinational Enterprise", "journal": "Review of International Economics", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1596/1813-9450-7186", "title": "Can the Knowledge Capital Model Explain Foreign Investment in Services?

In that year a multi-level framework was designed that included a national and seven regional Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3). The role of regions in research and innovation policy was much less advanced in Portugal than other (Western) European countries, but a logical step to implement a concept that gives local actors a prominent role in strategy development through a process of entrepreneurial discovery. Smart Specialisation is a difficult concept to implement successfully because it crosses policy responsibilities and geographical levels. This report finds that a number of problems in the governance of S3 implementation accentuated these difficulties in Portugal: a governance structure that was never really activated; a policy mix constrained by the legal framework governing R&I spending by the European Structural and Investment Funds, preventing a flexible place based approach th...", "published_on": "2020-07-22", "added_on": "2020-09-20", "document_url": "https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/5842d785-cc8a-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=5842d785-cc8a-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/4571a6982189775f150eb22045fa7f32.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/4571a6982189775f150eb22045fa7f32.png", "topics": ["Startup company", "Monitoring and evaluation", "Information", "Decentralization", "Evidence-based medicine", "European Union", "Strategic management", "Tourism", "Perception", "Science", "Strategy", "Design", "Creative industries", "System", "Creativity", "Education", "Public participation (decision making)", "Research and development", "Economic growth", "Portugal", "Sustainability", "Multi-level governance", "Technology", "Research", "Technology roadmap", "Entrepreneurship", "Evaluation", "Innovation", "Governance", "Human activities", "Cognition", "Business", "Decision-making", "Economy", "Interreg", "SWOT analysis", "Health", "Industry", "Goal", "Qualitative research", "Resource", "University", "Forestry", "Business model", "Learning", "Good governance", "Data", "Market (economics)", "Implementation", "Human capital", "Knowledge", "Organization", "Psychological concepts", "Venture capital", "Employment", "Knowledge economy", "Natural resource", "Small and medium-sized enterprises", "Institution", "Policy", "Logistics", "Participatory design", "Team", "Communication"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economy", "science and technology>social sciences", "education"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["KJ-NA-30287-EN-N", "10.2760/363370", "9789276204008", "1831-9424"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1787/eco_surveys-prt-2019-en", "title": "OECD Economic Surveys: Portugal 2019", "journal": "OECD Economic Surveys: Portugal 2012", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264308138-en", "title": "OECD Review of Higher Education, Research and Innovation: Portugal", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/fea62108-en", "title": "Decentralisation and Regionalisation in Portugal", "journal": "Investing Together", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1016/b978-0-12-804137-6.00012-7", "title": "From Strategy to Implementation: The Real Challenge for Smart Specialization Policy", "publisher": "Elsevier"}, {"doi": "10.1016/s0016-7185(99)00031-7", "title": "Regional institutions and knowledge \u2013 tracking new forms of regional development policy", "journal": "Geoforum", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1080/00343400701565846", "title": "Governance, Science Policy and Regions: An Introduction", "journal": "Regional Studies", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1007/s00191-002-0113-0", "title": "What is the systems perspective to Innovation and Technology Policy(ITP) and how can we apply it to developing and newly industrialized economies?", "journal": "Journal of Evolutionary Economics", "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC"}, {"doi": "10.2307/2555502", "title": "A Penny for Your Quotes: Patent Citations and the Value of Innovations", "journal": "The RAND Journal of Economics", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.respol.2007.01.006", "title": "Forms of knowledge and modes of innovation", "journal": "Research Policy", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1111/j.1475-6765.2004.00149.x", "title": "'Governance' as a bridge between disciplines: Cross-disciplinary inspiration regarding shifts in governance and problems of governability, accountability and legitimacy", "journal": "European Journal of Political Research", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1017/s0143814x00000994", "title": "Who Governs Intermediary Agencies?

It is a complex system in itself, consisting of an ever-changing infrastructure used by a large number of actors of very different sizes. The boundaries of the power system are characterised by ever-evolving interfaces with equally complex subsystems such as gas transport and distribution, heating and cooling, and, increasingly, transport. The situation is further complicated by the fact that electricity is only a carrier, able to fulfil demand for such things as lighting, heat or mobility. One specific and fundamental feature of the electricity system is that demand and generation must match at any time, while satisfying technical and economic constraints. In most of the world\u2019s power systems, only relatively small quantities of electricity can be stored, and only for limited periods of time.

However, not only do we lack the tools to determine what achievements will be attained in the near future, but we even underestimate what various technologies in AI are capable of today. Certainly, the translation from scientific papers and benchmark performance to products is faster in AI than in other non-digital sectors. However, it is often the case that research breakthroughs do not directly translate to a technology that is ready to use in real-world environments. This document describes an example-based methodology to categorise and assess several AI technologies, by mapping them onto Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) (e.g., maturity and availability levels). We first interpret the nine TRLs in the context of AI and identify different categories in AI to which they can be assigned. We then introduce new bidimensional plots, called readiness-vs-generality charts, where we see that higher TRLs are achievable for ...", "published_on": "2020-11-30", "added_on": "2020-12-07",

This approach has been explicitly described for acute toxicity, corrosion/irritation to skin, serious eye damage/eye irritation and, under certain conditions, for Specific Target Organ Toxicity (STOT). This is based on the assumption that all substances exerting this hazardous effect contribute to the overall hazard of the mixture in proportion to their concentration and potency. A mixture is classified as hazardous when the sum of the concentrations of such substances present in the mixture above the specified cut-off value (applying a weighting factor for potency where appropriate) exceeds the applicable concentration limit specified in the regulatory text.

At the same time, progress in productive efficiency \u2013 as measured by total factor productivity (TFP) growth \u2013 sharply declined in Europe and has remained weak since the mid-1990s whereas the US has seen acceleration in TFP. The near-stagnant TFP in market services in the EU-15 is particularly worrying. In both the EU-15 and the US, the growth contributions from ICT are found to be smaller than those from TFP.

It has been prepared by Austria in the frame of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 793/93 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances, following the principles for assessment of the risks to man and the environment, laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1488/94. The evaluation considers the emissions and the resulting exposure to the environment and the human populations in all life cycle steps. Following the exposure assessment, the environmental risk characterisation for each protection goal in the aquatic, terrestrial and atmospheric compartment has been determined. For human health the scenarios for occupational exposure, consumer exposure and humans exposed via the environment have been examined and the possible risks have been identified. The human health risk assessment for o-anisidine concludes that there is at present concern for workers, consumers and humans exposed via the environment.

The benefits are measured principally in additional GDP generated or more rational use of public resources.

Focusing on the 2020 horizon, the study also formulates policy options to realize that potential.

Since computational methods cover a broad range of models and tools, emphasis was placed on Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) and Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models, and their potential role in predicting NM properties. In addition, the status of a diverse array of compartment-based mathematical models was assessed. These models comprised toxicokinetic (TK), toxicodynamic (TD), in vitro and in vivo dosimetry, and environmental fate models.

Whether for Earth or Space observation, they qualify being called 'big data' given the sheer volume of sensed data (archived data reaching the exabyte scale), their high velocity (new data is acquired almost on a continuous basis and with an increasing rate), their variety (data is delivered by sensors acting over various frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum in passive and active modes), as well as their veracity (sensed data is associated with uncertainty and accuracy measurements). Last but not least, the value of big data from space depends on our capacity to extract information and meaning from them. The goal of the Big Data from Space conference is to bring together researchers, engineers, developers, and users in the area of Big Data from Space.

Will the improvement in the position of women on the labour market during the crisis be sustained or slip away with the recovery? Is the divisive issue of undeclared work being effectively addressed? Will all Member States progress equally, or do the weakest risk falling further behind? Have national social security systems been effective and efficient in maintaining incomes during the recession and in addressing their longer-term goals?

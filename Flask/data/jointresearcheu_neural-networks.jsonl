The BitCoin price responds negatively to the BitCoin velocity, whereas positive shocks to the BitCoin stock, interest rate and the size of the BitCoin economy exercise an upward pressure on the BitCoin price.", "published_on": "2019-01-14", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC115098", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC115098/the_price_of_bitcoin_garch_evidence_from_high_frequency_data_2.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/4d72414b3fa3b2a38c47d29a9c86b47a.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/4d72414b3fa3b2a38c47d29a9c86b47a.png", "topics": ["Finance", "Economy", "Autocorrelation", "Demand for money", "Bitcoin", "Money supply", "Volatility (finance)", "Money", "Heteroscedasticity", "Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity", "Currency", "Blockchain", "Variance", "Errors and residuals", "Market (economics)", "High frequency data", "Time series", "Interest rate", "Interest", "Price", "Demand", "Economics", "Inflation", "Exchange rate", "Autoregressive model"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["science and technology>social sciences", "economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics", "science and technology>social sciences>economics", "science and technology>mathematics", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics>investments", "economy, business and finance>economy"], "source_tags": ["Information society", "Innovation and growth"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/06822", "9789279985706", "JRC115098", "EUR 29598 EN", "OP KJ-NA-29598-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1016/j.frl.2015.10.008", "title": "Bitcoin, gold and the dollar \u2013 A GARCH volatility analysis", "journal": "Finance Research Letters", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.econlet.2017.06.023", "title": "Volatility estimation for Bitcoin: A comparison of GARCH models", "journal": "Economics Letters", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.2139/ssrn.2961405", "title": "Can Bitcoin Become a Viable Alternative to Fiat Currencies?

The effects of climatic and non-climatic hazards on local population health and ecosystems are reviewed, such as heatwaves, air pollution and the atmospheric dust which comes from the Saharan dessert. The potential combination or overlapping effects of these hazards are also explored.According to the literature reviewed, heatwaves, air pollution, and Saharan dust events have been producing negative effects on the population, in terms of both morbidity and mortality, as well as the environment, such as forest fires related impacts. In terms of health impacts, elderly and local people with chronic diseases are those more vulnerable to the previous hazards.

While the dioxin contamination is mainly located along the German part of the catchment, PCBs are more abundant in the Czech section. In some of the 43 solid samples investigated high levels of contamination were detected. Selected orientation benchmarks for dioxins and PCBs in sediments and fish are exceeded, suggesting potential hazards for organisms in the contaminated rivers and for human consumption. Elevated dioxin concentrations in the Spittelwasser-Mulde system and the Saale catchment, together with consistent dioxin congener patterns Elbe downstream of the confluence, indicate that the region of Bitterfeld-Wolfen is the predominant source of the dioxin pollution, which can be traced until far off shore in the sediments of the North Sea near Helgoland. Thermal metal, presumably Magnesium production via fused salt electrolysis during the 2nd world war is the most probable primary, historic source of the dioxin contamination.The spatial distribution of dioxins as seen in 2008 matched well with earlier campaigns in 2002, both for aquatic solids and alluvial soils, suggesting minor change of the situation since then.Also the samples from the North Sea revealed elevated levels of dioxins that display the congener pattern from the Bitterfeld-Wolfen Region. In contrast to the PCDD/Fs, PCBs are mainly present in the in the Upper Elbe in the Czech Republic. After the German border PCBs display an overall decrease.Other than PCDD/Fs, PCB emissions into the Elbe cannot be attributed to a dominant source or region. Indicator PCBs did rise more or less constantly in concentration until the German border, suggesting a variety of cumulative emission sources along the whole Czech stretch.Thus, no specific recommendation on how to decrease the PCB pressure on the River Elbe can be given on the basis of the data acquired in this study. Detailed regional scale monitoring in the Czech stretch, together with the evaluation of production statistics regarding potential PCB sources are needed here. After all the PCB toxicity in eel is exceeding that of PCDD/F up to an order of magnitude (investigations of eels taken after the flood event in August 2002).As an amendment to the chemical analyses, two Ah-receptor based bioassays (DR CALUXR and EROD), which display the dioxin\u2013like activity of all pollutants present, were performed on a subset of the samples (blind study). For The DR CALUXR the comparison revealed a good agreement between the HRGC/HRMS results along the German stretch and the bioassay. However, along the Czech section of the Elbe the DR CALUXR displayed a 10 times higher dioxin-like activity than the chemical analyses. This suggests that the solid material in the Czech section contains additional persistent dioxin-like acting pollutants. In comparison to the DR CALUXR test, the EROD assay displayed even higher dioxin-like activities. The differences can be explained by the fact that the clean up procedure for the DR CALUXR eliminated the less persistent organic pollutants in the extract, while the EROD procedure remained sensitive to those. Regarding the risk for the aquatic food chain and the human diet, the reduction of PCBs in the River Elbe ecosystem appears crucial as indicated by the dominance of the PCB over the PCDD/Fs in toxicity equivalents detected in eel samples.", "published_on": "2011-10-18", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC63974", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC63974/lbna24766enc.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/756922b025474d705e76c79e83f97408.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/756922b025474d705e76c79e83f97408.png", "topics": ["Polychlorinated biphenyl", "Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins", "Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds", "Toxic equivalency factor", "Environmental science", "Self-organizing map", "Chemistry", "Environmental technology", "Physical sciences", "Natural environment"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "environment>natural resources", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>chemicals", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>chemicals>organic chemical", "environment>natural resources>water", "environment>environmental pollution", "environment"], "source_tags": ["Environment and climate change"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2788/72323"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1016/s0045-6535(00)00310-6", "title": "Dioxin and dioxin-like PCB impurities in some Japanese agrochemical formulations", "journal": "Chemosphere", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/s0045-6535(98)00263-x", "title": "Dioxin (PCDD/F) in the river elbe - investigations of their origin by multivariate statistical methods", "journal": "Chemosphere", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.09.065", "title": "Vertical profile of PCDD/Fs, dioxin-like PCBs, other PCBs, PAHs, chlorobenzenes, DDX, HCHs, organotin compounds and chlorinated ethers in dated sediment/soil cores from flood-plains of the river Elbe, Germany", "journal": "Chemosphere", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.08.057", "title": "Congener fingerprints of tetra- through octa-chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans in Baltic surface sediments and their relations to potential sources", "journal": "Chemosphere", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1007/698_2014_317", "title": "Semivolatile Organic Compounds in Water, Suspended Particulate Matter, Sediments and Biota in the Danube", "journal": "The Handbook of Environmental Chemistry", "publisher": "Springer Berlin Heidelberg"}, {"doi": "10.1007/bf00322885", "title": "Investigations on sample pretreatment for the determination of selected metals and organochlorine compounds in suspended particulate matter of the River Elbe", "journal": "Fresenius' Journal of Analytical Chemistry", "publisher": "Springer Nature America, Inc"}, {"doi": "10.1002/9783527678488.hbal2003004", "title": "Kontaminierte Sedimente: Gef\u00e4hrdungsabsch\u00e4tzung von Gew\u00e4ssersedimenten - Handlungsempfehlungen und Bewertungsvorschl\u00e4ge f\u00fcr eine integrierte Bewertung", "publisher": "Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The Commission may consult the group on any matter relating to marine and fisheries biology, fishing gear technology, fisheries economics, fisheries governance, ecosystem effects of fisheries, aquaculture or similar disciplines. This report is the fifth of a suite of STECF EWG reports dedicated to the fishing effort regime in the Western Mediterranean Sea, following EWG reports 18-09, 18-13, 19-01 and 19-14. The group was requested to progress to update mixed fisheries models and F-E analyses with the most recent data and the most recent stock assessments, to run a number of effort scenarios until 2025, to draft a mixed-fisheries advice including relevant scenarios and displays, and to discuss next steps. In EMU 1, good progresses were achieved in combining effort and catch data from both France and Spain into the bioeconomic multifleet model IAM.

As part of the pilot project \u2018Integrated techniques for the seismic strengthening and energy efficiency of existing buildings\u2019, renovation scenarios are defined, and their impact is investigated considering seismic and energy efficiency upgrading of residential buildings, independently and in an integrated way. An integrated analysis framework, proposed earlier to identify priority regions across the EU, is extended here to investigate the impact of renovation scenarios. A series of impact metrics are introduced to investigate the renovation potential of regions (capacity of individual building classes within a region to yield benefit), and the impact of renovation scenarios (benefit in absolute terms) across the EU with a focus on priority regions. Impact metrics include benefit-to-cost ratios along with the reduction in economic loss, loss of life, and space heating energy c...", "published_on": "2022-11-01", "added_on": "2022-12-19",

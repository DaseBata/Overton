The project set out to explore during the period 2017-2020 the challenges and opportunities that the digital transformation is posing to the governance of society. We focused our attention on the governance of data as a key aspect to understand and shape the governance of society. Data is a key resource in the digital economy, and control over the way it is generated, aggregated, and value is extracted and distributed in society is crucial. For this reason we analysed emerging governance models to distribute the value generated from data moreequitably in society. The digital transformation, the rise of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things offer also new opportunities for new forms of policy design, implementation, and assessment providing more personalised support to those who need it and being more participative throughout the policy cycle.

An inventory of 167 blockchain technology use cases from national, regional and local European governments map the use of blockchain technology in public services. Each use case provides insights into the level of adoption of this technology. The findings highlight the use of blockchain technology by public administrations as an overall positive trend and that blockchain technology could significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public administrations. However, public administration must take many steps before blockchain technology can solve their real-life challenges. The breaking down of barriers to blockchain technology adoption requires significant consideration by policymakers. Progress in this area will depend on increasing efforts to implement more large-scale use cases, facilitating collaboration between organisations and providing legal certainty.

In the last four years, all Western Balkan economies made progress in developing their first Smart Specialisation strategies. This development led to revealing preliminary or final priority areas in most of them, highlighting few potentially common ones for the entire region.

To respond to the challenges ahead, S3 must also contribute to the transition towards more sustainable and inclusive pathways, in line with the European Green Deal\u2019s objectives and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this sense, we argue that we need a transformative Smart Specialisation, sustained by a transformative EDP.

The analysis is based on data drawn from EU LFS 2015-2016 and PIAAC 2012 surveys.

As for the US and China, they are much stronger in newer high-tech sectors, and have maintained and even increased their strength in the last decade.For the EU, this causes a lower overall share of net sales and of R&D investment in sectors of high R&D intensity, compared with the full sample (all sectors). Consequently, there is a lower impact on the aggregate (all sectors) result for EU R&D intensity. The EU has a small number of global players in key sectors of high R&D intensity, such as biotechnology and ICT.

Together with North America and East Asia, the EU is moving towards longer-living, lower-fertility, and higher-educated societies. Facing this new demographic frontier naturally prompts the questions: Who will live and work in Europe in the coming decades? How many, and with what skills? To answer these, this report examines the key factors that will shape European demographics over the coming decades. By examining not only the role of migration, fertility and mortality, but also education levels and labour force participation rates, a more comprehensive view of possible futures can be outlined than the conventional demographic projections allow for. The first five sections of this report focus on demographic challenges inside the EU, such as population ageing, a shrinking labour force, more non-working people being dependent on working people, and showing the impact of high levels of emigration in some ...", "published_on": "2019-05-27", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC116398", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC116398/demographic_en_executive_summary_online.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/0d16c62cd4d7fe6033c107ab797d60c0.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/0d16c62cd4d7fe6033c107ab797d60c0.png", "topics": ["Human migration", "Immigration", "Economic growth", "Labour economics", "Unemployment", "Dependency ratio", "Climate change", "International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis", "Population growth", "Human capital flight", "Education", "Ageing", "Population", "European Union", "Demography", "Economy", "Human activities", "Environmental social science", "Refugee", "Demographic transition", "Total fertility rate", "World population", "Africa", "Youth unemployment", "Sustainability", "Shared Socioeconomic Pathways", "Asylum seeker", "Violence", "Work permit", "Human capital", "Fertility", "Canada", "Informal economy", "Female education", "Population decline", "Employment", "Productivity", "Politics", "Green card", "Skilled worker", "Family planning", "Europe", "Emigration", "Pension", "Developing country", "Sweden", "Poverty", "Workforce", "Economic inequality", "Social issues", "Actuarial science", "Third country resettlement", "Policy", "Family", "Birth rate", "Life expectancy", "Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union", "Drought", "Branches of science", "Economics", "Asia"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["politics>government policy", "politics", "education", "environment", "science and technology", "politics>government policy>migration of people"], "source_tags": ["Economic and monetary Union", "Environment and climate change", "Innovation and growth", "JRC corporate"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/590301", "10.2760/751889", "10.2760/952572", "9789276032151", "9789276032168", "9789276078760", "JRC116398", "EUR 29739 EN", "OP KJ-NA-29739-EN-C", "OP KJ-NA-29739-EN-E", "OP KJ-NA-29739-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2760/450834", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2760/98611", "title": null, "publisher": null}], "policy": [], "news": [], "people": [{"person": "Delilah Al Khudhairy", "affiliation": "Joint Research Centre", "snippet": "JRC\nDelilah Al Khudhairy\nEuropean Commission, Joint Research Centre, Rue du Champ de Mars 21, 1050 Brussels, Belgium\nEmail: Delilah.AL-KHUDHAIRY@ec.europa.eu\nTel. +32 22999158"}, {"person": "Wolfgang Lutz", "affiliation": "International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis", "snippet": "Contact information\nIIASA\nWolfgang Lutz (Ed.)\nInternational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Schlossplatz 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria\nEmail: lutz@iiasa.ac.at\nTel. +43(0) 2236807294"}]}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "  245 million 215 million    2015    2015    226 million 245 million    35  59                 A smaller, better-educated labour force may proveto be more adaptable to the changing nature of work,automation and artificial intelligence                       123                   100                       106                   100                       lowest ratioof dependentsto workers             Migration increases the EUs total labour", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC116398/demographic_en_executive_summary_online.pdf", "pdf_title": "PDF #2", "page": "10"}, {"type": "text", "text": "  245 million 215 million    2015    2015    226 million 245 million    35  59                 A smaller, better-educated labour force may proveto be more adaptable to the changing nature of work,automation and artificial intelligence                       123                   100                       106                   100                       lowest ratioof dependentsto workers             Migration increases the EUs total labour", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC116398/demographic_online_20190527.pdf", "pdf_title": "PDF #1", "page": "12"}]}

The principle of the Three Rs, i.e. Replacement, Reduction and Refinement of animal use in basic, applied and translational research, as well as for regulatory testing purposes, is firmly anchored in EU legislation, with complete phasing out of animal procedures being the ultimate goal. This is achievable through a transition to new approach methodologies and models based on innovative non-animal technologies and better understanding of biology and disease.

As Ukraine is a leading producer of purified neon gas, a critical input for the manufacture of semiconductors, neon\u2019s supply disruption poses the greatest challenges. A neon scarcity worldwide could substantially impact industrial supply chains reliant on semiconductors.The EU is a net exporter of rare gases by value.

At the same time, forests are vulnerable systems because the long life-span of trees limits the possibility of rapid adaptation to drastic environmental changes. Climate-driven disturbances in forests, such as fires, windstorms and insect outbreaks, are expected to rise drastically under global warming. As a result, key forest services, such as carbon sequestration and supply of wood materials, could be seriously affected in the near future. Despite the relevance and urgency of the issue, little is known about the vulnerability of European forests to multiple climate-related hazards and the adaptation benefits of alternative forest management strategies.

Using the special module of the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions micro-data on well-being and national aggregates from the World Happiness Report, the vulnerability indicator used is shown to be statistically significant for happiness perceptions at both the individual and aggregate levels. At the micro level, the economic importance of income vulnerability for the middle class is on a par with (or even greater than) economic factors such as severe material deprivation, difficulty of finding a job, or the acute financial burden of housing or debt repayments. The aggregate income vulnerability of the middle class is also one of the most significant factors affecting national happiness, along with gross domestic product per capita and perceptions of corruption.

In the EU value chain, nearly 80% of input suppliers and 63% of customers to the companies in the chain are located outside the EU, defining the boundaries of EU vulnerability and its dependence on geopolitical considerations. EU dependency on foreign jurisdictions appears at different levels of the supply chain. The provision of raw materials and intermediate inputs, the dependency on water and energy are only some examples of potential sources of vulnerabilities if natural or man-made risks occur.

The study presents a solid basis for these processes in the Eastern Partnership region by offering an extensive quantitative analysis of national-level potential in the economy, innovation, science and technology. A limited number of economic and innovation (E&I) specialisation domains matched with relevant scientific and technological (S&T) specialisation domains are identified for each Eastern Partnership country. The study proposes a new method to identify concordances between the EI and ST specialisation domains so that they can be used to inform ongoing Smart Specialisation processes in the Eastern Partnership countries with available international data.Interested countries need to compliment this analysis with the relevant national data sources and other useful information resulting from the qualitative expert inputs and stakeholder engagement.

Organisational, behavioural and functional models etc applied into the systems can be copied from the real world.The growing interest in agent technologies in the European Union was expressed through the foundation of the Coordination Action for Agent-Based Computing, funded under the European Commission's Sixth Framework Programme (FP6).

First, we provide some background of the main theoretical frameworks (SBTC and RBTC) used by researchers to explain recent changes in the employment distribution. Second, we review the most important empirical studies using the RBTC model. Overall, the prevailing economic literature provides empirical support to the RBTC model: cheaper computerisation progressively replaces human labour in routine tasks, thereby leading to an increase in the relative demand for workers performing non-routine tasks. Third, we show that the RBTC captures quite well the changes in the employment distribution, but we argue that it presents challenges from a conceptual, operational, and empirical point of view. These challenges are discussed in the report.Finally, we argue that the literature has yet to converge to a model that consistently explains how technology affects the labour demand.

The increasing number of mobile phone users in Africa, combined with improved networks and broadband coverage, makes it increasingly possible to use mobile-based crowdsourcing to obtain accurate and up-to-date food price information. The use of mobile technologies also affords the possibility of reaching a large number of volunteers (crowd workers) in specific geographic locations, thus enhancing the available sets of information. This study provides a literature review of the concept of crowdsourcing and an overview and analysis of previous and on-going innovative food price collection initiatives in developing countries, particularly in Africa.

In recent years, large forest fires have repeatedly affected Europe, in particular the Mediterranean countries. Fire danger is influenced by weather in the short term, and by climate when considering longer time intervals. In this work, the emphasis is on the direct influence on fire danger of weather and climate.For climate analysis at the continental scale, a daily high-emission scenario (RCP 8.5) was considered up to the end of the century, and a mitigation scenario that limits global warming to 2 \u00b0C was also assessed. To estimate fire danger, the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) system was used. FWI provides a uniform numerical rating of relative fire potential, by combining the information from daily local temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and precipitation values. The FWI is standardised to consider a reference fuel behaviour irrespective of other factors. It is thus well suited to support harmonised comparisons, to highlight th...", "published_on": "2018-01-17", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url":

COVID-19 caused sudden economic, psychological, and partly physical shocks to markets, societal sub-systems (e.g., education, food, health), and people. As a direct consequence, today, food security and resilience are at stake. The effects on bio-based products and bioenergy (in particular: biofuels) vary and their role in the recovery (with possible changes in customer\u2019s behaviour) could differ as well. The linkages of the bioeconomy to post-pandemic recovery with regard to impacts and possible responses are currently being discussed by many institutions and initiatives, even though there is currently limited data on the impact of the pandemic on the bioeconomy.

This paper proposes to use a bivariate Error Correction model to forecast the needs of beds in intensive care, jointly with the number of patients hospitalised with Covid-19 symptoms. Error Correction models are found to provide reliable forecasts that are tailored to the local characteristics both of epidemic dynamics and of hospital practice for various regions in Europe in Italy, France and Scotland, both at the onset and at later stages of the spread of the disease. This reasonable forecast performance suggests that the present approach may be useful also beyond the set of analysed regions.", "published_on": "2020-09-24", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url":

This is done for four periods, separated by the financial crisis and the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis. Results show that there is a wide diversity of patterns of structural change across periods and countries in Europe. During the expansive phase of the business cycle, the pattern that was more widespread was job upgrading, with the number of workers increasing more in high-paid jobs (especially in private and public services). During the financial crisis (2008-2010) and the following period (2011-2019), the patterns of structural change were much more diverse. Still, some general lines can be traced. Workers that were hardest hit by the financial crisis were located in the middle of the wage structure.

An important tool within this framework is the MOLAND (Monitoring Land Use/Cover Dynamics) model for urban and regional growth forecast. The model is part of an integrated methodology based on a set of spatial planning tools that can be used for assessing, monitoring and modelling the development of urban and regional environments.The MOLAND model has been specifically designed for urban and regional development assessment. It is based on a spatial dynamics bottom-up approach. The model takes as input several georeferenced datasets for the future simulation of urban areas and/or regions.

The analyses focus on 10 million patent families from selected patent offices in the years 2002-2015. The method proposed identified 85,034 defence inventions (0.9%) that were compared with the civilian inventions along several dimensions (time, geography, technological clusters). This study operationalises dual use from both a civilian to a military application (CM dual use) and in the opposite direction (MC dual use). The presence of CM dual inventions is 1.4% of the total civilian sample, with a slightly decreasing trend. They are four times the MCs in absolute numbers.

Some of the published global QSARs available have been recently characterised and evaluated elsewhere in accordance with the OECD principles. An overview of expert systems capable of predicting skin sensitisation is also provided.

However, the EU has been experiencing a significant slowdown in labour productivity and total factor productivity growth, a phenomenon which has even exacerbated over the last decade, contrary to what would be expected in the recovery from the financial crisis. The trends and driving forces of the current sluggish productivity growth in Europe are analysed in this report with a special emphasis on services. After reviewing the literature in the field, the report zooms in on the role played by factors such as structural change, intangible investments, firm size distribution, firm demography, labour dynamics, zombie firms, business cycle dynamics and public expenditure and assesses their impact on productivity growth based on a variety of data sources and methodologies.

What are the possible future disruptive global challenges? And how can the EU position itself to take an active role in shaping a response to them? This publication offers possible answers to these questions through the identification of three main challenges and potential responses to these, and concludes that the main policy issues to be considered at EU level are: policy alignment towards sustainability; social diversity and the use of ICT for citizen empowerment; and the need to embed capabilities for anticipating future challenges to enable these to become new opportunities. The methodology applied combines widely accepted quantified trends by 2025 and beyond with the opinions of experts and policy makers on the likely consequences of these trends and wild cards. A multi-criteria quantitative analysis (Robust Portfolio Modelling) was used as a novel element to prioritise issues as a basis for discussion with selected experts and policy makers.

The objective of the midterm workshop was to improve stakeholder understanding on critical energy efficiency and seismic safety upgrades to ageing buildings, and to collect feedback on the Pilot Project. The workshop, spread along six different sessions, started with interventions from a Member of the European Parliament, a Member of the European Committee of the Regions, European Commission officers, and representatives from public authorities and a professional association. More than 30 technical presentations were delivered by JRC Pilot Project team members and external experts, complemented by discussions and polls that were organised throughout the workshop sessions. The report provides summaries of the presented work by action of the Pilot Project along with expected developments and issues that deserve further consideration. Topics include technologies for seismic, energy, and combined upgrading of existing buildings, methodologies to evaluate the effect of combined upgrading, regional prioritisation based on multiple indicators, implementing renovation measures, intervention scenarios, outreach activities as well as external activities and projects complementary to the Pilot Project objectives. Issues that attracted the attention of the workshop participants and relevant feedback received through interactive sessions and tools (e.g. discussions, polls, etc.) are further highlighted. The final part of the report is dedicated to the recently launched New European Bauhaus and feedback on the initiative received through relevant polls. Workshop participation statistics and satisfaction survey results indicate a positive reception of this first wide dissemination effort of the Pilot Project objectives and output from a diverse

The scope of this methodological report is therefore to define: a) The approach to the selection and development of the case studies on ICT enabled integrated care services and b) A framework of analysis that facilitates the definition of best practice and takes into account transferability aspects.", "published_on": "2015-01-07", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC92703", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC92703/jrc92703.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/e2a6448815ec4717379593fdce5c73fc.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/e2a6448815ec4717379593fdce5c73fc.png", "topics": ["Health care", "Health", "Telehealth", "Preventive healthcare", "Research", "Chronic condition", "Self-care", "Disease", "Frailty syndrome", "Geriatrics", "Clinical pathway", "Governance", "Patient", "Evaluation", "Qualitative research", "Healthy Life Years", "Education", "Caregiver", "Health system", "Physical therapy", "Nursing", "Medicine", "Public services", "Branches of science", "Health sciences", "Social programs", "Sampling (statistics)", "Best practice", "Transitional care", "Integrated care", "Hospital", "Dependent and independent variables", "Team", "Innovation", "Quantitative research", "Social work", "Health care quality", "European Union", "Remote patient monitoring", "Evidence-based medicine", "Heart failure", "Ageing", "Dementia", "Comorbidity", "Medical diagnosis", "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "Cost-effectiveness analysis", "Telenursing", "Interview", "Case study", "Information and communications technology", "Statistics", "Patient participation", "General practitioner", "Policy", "Nursing home", "Primary care", "Clinical trial", "Palliative care", "Multimethodology"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "health>health treatment", "health", "health>diseases and conditions", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology", "health>health treatment>medicine"], "source_tags": ["Information society"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2791/984936", "9789279446788", "JRC92703", "EUR 27010", "OP LF-NA-27010-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1007/s10433-008-0073-9", "title": "Case management method applied to older adults in the primary care centres in Burjassot (Valencian Region, Spain)", "journal": "European Journal of Ageing", "publisher": "Springer Nature"}, {"doi": "10.1682/jrrd.2006.03.0029", "title": "Changing the location of care: Management of patients with chronic conditions in Veterans Health Administration using care coordination/home telehealth", "journal": "Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development", "publisher": "Journal of Rehabilitation Research & Development"}, {"doi": "10.1097/00005650-199904000-00005", "title": "The Effects of Managed Care on Physician and Clinical Integration in Hospitals", "journal": "Medical Care", "publisher": "Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health)"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.healthpol.2013.03.005", "title": "Exploring the role of ICT in the provision of integrated care\u2014Evidence from eight countries", "journal": "Health Policy", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.jbi.2006.06.002", "title": "Workflow modeling in critical care: Piecing together your own puzzle", "journal": "Journal of Biomedical Informatics", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.2174/1874944501205010036", "title": "The Art of Integrating Care: Theories Revisited", "journal": "The Open Public Health Journal", "publisher": "Bentham Science Publishers Ltd."}, {"doi": "10.2791/93413", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.12927/hcq.2009.21092", "title": "Ten Key Principles for Successful Health Systems Integration", "journal": "Healthcare Quarterly", "publisher": "Longwoods Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1258/jtt.2011.110505", "title": "Systematic review of studies of the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine and telecare.

First, it is indicated that post-consumer textile waste is the largest waste fraction, and that annually more than 8 million tonnes used and waste textiles are incinerated or landfilled, a much higher share than re-use, preparing for re-use and recycling together. Textile waste recycling is limited and currently dominated by transforming apparel and home textiles into cleaning rags and insulation materials, but closed-loop recycling facilities are emerging in the EU, particularly for post-industrial textile waste.

However, despite a wealth of theoretical speculation and empirical evidence, a consensus regarding the employment effect of ICT remains elusive. This report provides an overview of current perspectives on the employment impact of ICT. The main objective of this paper is to convey the need for a careful and open-minded assessment of the relation between employment and ICT. This assessment is needed in order to capture the full complexity of the factors influencing this relation, the transmission mechanisms involved, and the associated labour market effects. Our review devotes equal space to each mainstream economic theory on the complex connection between ICT and employment, while giving greater emphasis to those studies which provide empirical support to sound the...", "published_on": "2013-10-14", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC76143", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC76143/jrc76143.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/28a659e7f408f269338543d42d77da36.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/28a659e7f408f269338543d42d77da36.png", "topics": ["Labour economics", "Employment", "Unemployment", "Economic growth", "Innovation", "Productivity", "Economics", "Technological unemployment", "Macroeconomics", "Market (economics)", "Causes of income inequality in the United States", "European Union", "Technological change", "Globalization", "Offshoring", "Automation", "Information and communications technology", "Perfect competition", "Research", "Economic inequality", "Competition", "Human activities", "Business", "Full employment", "Profit (economics)", "Supply (economics)", "Outsourcing", "Europe 2020", "Theory", "Recession", "Economy", "Comparative advantage", "Technology", "Demand", "Industry", "Sustainability", "Educational technology", "Income", "Redistribution of income and wealth", "Heckscher\u2013Ohlin model", "Oligopoly", "Political polarization", "Human capital", "Investment", "Neoclassical economics", "Information technology", "Consumer choice", "Education", "United States", "Price", "Economic equilibrium", "Supply-side economics", "Income distribution", "Government spending", "Europe", "Nationalization"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "labour", "labour>employment", "labour>unemployment", "economy, business and finance>economy", "science and technology", "education"], "source_tags": ["Information society"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2791/2141", "9789279327209", "JRC76143", "EUR EUR 26121", "OP LF-NA-26121-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2307/2534739", "title": "International Trade and American Wages in the 1980s: Giant Sucking Sound or Small Hiccup?", "journal": "Brookings Papers on Economic Activity.

The economies of the Western Balkan region are applying Smart Specialisation to determine the economic domains in which they should direct further efforts towards exploiting their potential. The recent studies show many similarities in regard to key economic domains across the Western Balkans. In order to investigate the strengths of some of the key domains in the region and to better understand both national and regional competitiveness in that regard, analysis of competitive value chains was carried out in the following six areas: textile, automotive, agrifood, energy, tourism and ICT industries. The work employed a specific methodology and looked into various dimensions for determining the potential of the Western Balkan economies in relation to the selected value chains.

The project aimed to provide an overview of Open Educational Practices in adult learning in Europe, identifying enablers and barriers to successful implementation of practices with OER. The report identifies over 150 Open Educational Resources (OER) initiatives, and develops a typology that classifies them primarily by their main activity type. A survey based on the typology drew 36 responses from initiative leaders, and these are analysed against a context of developments in adult learning to arrive at an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats facing OER in adult learning in Europe.

However, the Amazon forest has already lost up to 20% of its original area since the 1970s and is under constant threat of ongoing deforestation and forest degradation. Disturbances in the forest cover lead to carbon emissions, endanger the livelihoods of indigenous people, and threaten biodiversity in the Amazon. In 2021, according to JRC-TMF data, the Pan-Amazon region showed a 37% decrease in forest disturbances (comprising deforestation and forest degradation) compared to the previous year (23,383 km2 of new disturbances in 2021 vs. 37,293 km2 in 2020). This decrease can be mainly explained by the decrease in forest fires in 2021, which apparently has been a year of high precipitation during the \u2018fire season\u2019 (July-November) in the Southern and Eastern Amazon regions. However, the decrease of burned areas in 2021 has ...", "published_on": "2022-08-15", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC130081", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC130081/JRC130081_01.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/8998a6ace8b40f5d7068632ec535dc76.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/8998a6ace8b40f5d7068632ec535dc76.png", "topics": ["Systems ecology", "Environmental conservation", "Environmental science", "Earth sciences", "Nature", "Natural environment", "Natural resource management", "Physical geography", "Earth phenomena", "Natural resources", "Evapotranspiration", "Deforestation in Brazil", "Water scarcity", "Fire", "Drainage basin", "Agriculture", "Tropics", "Ecology", "Greenhouse gas", "Brazil", "Albedo", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest", "Biomass", "Tropical rainforest", "Ecosystem", "Ecological resilience", "Precipitation", "Climate", "Drought", "Carbon cycle", "Habitat destruction", "Biodiversity", "Wildfire", "Forest", "Climate change", "BR-319", "Deforestation", "Amazon rainforest", "Effects of climate change", "Water", "Season", "Habitat fragmentation", "Forestry", "Cerrado", "Biogeography", "Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation", "Silviculture", "Human impact on the environment", "Conservation biology", "Nature conservation", "Deforestation and climate change", "Environmental social science", "Biogeochemistry", "Logging", "Climate change mitigation", "Hydrology", "Global environmental issues", "Ecosystem service", "Land development", "Tree", "Environment", "Old-growth forest", "Climate variability and change", "Temperate climate", "Sustainability", "Soil", "Carbon dioxide", "Fire regime", "Indigenous peoples", "Environmental protection"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["environment>natural resources>land resources", "environment", "environment>natural resources>land resources>forests", "environment>natural resources", "environment>natural resources>water", "science and technology"], "source_tags": ["Environment and climate change"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/398695", "9789276556565", "JRC130081", "EUR 31180 EN", "OP KJ-NA-31-180-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.3390/rs14040830", "title": "Mapping Key Indicators of Forest Restoration in the Amazon Using a Low-Cost Drone and Artificial Intelligence", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "publisher": "MDPI AG"}, {"doi": "10.1111/rec.13421", "title": "Precision restoration: a necessary approach to foster forest recovery in the 21st century", "journal": "Restoration Ecology", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1088/1748-9326/ac5ae1", "title": "Turnover rates of regenerated forests challenge restoration efforts in the Brazilian Atlantic forest", "journal": "Environmental Research Letters", "publisher": "IOP Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106145", "title": "Effects of sustainable forest management on tree diversity, timber volumes, and carbon stocks in an ecotone forest in the northern Brazilian Amazon", "journal": "Land Use Policy", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1126/sciadv.abd2713", "title": "Tracking and classifying Amazon fire events in near real time", "journal": "Science Advances", "publisher": "American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)"}, {"doi": "10.1038/s41467-021-26822-7", "title": "Health impacts of wildfire-related air pollution in Brazil: a nationwide study of more than 2 million hospital admissions between 2008 and 2018", "journal": "Nature Communications", "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC"}, {"doi": "10.3389/frsen.2022.825190", "title": "Global Trends of Forest Loss Due to Fire From 2001 to 2019", "publisher": "Frontiers Media SA"}, {"doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0268425", "title": "The economic value of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest ecosystem services: A meta-analysis of the Brazilian literature", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "publisher": "Public Library of Science (PLoS)"}, {"doi": "10.1088/1748-9326/ac3aa3", "title": "Spatio-temporal variation in dry season determines the Amazonian fire calendar", "journal": "Environmental Research Letters", "publisher": "IOP Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0269729", "title": "What\u2019s governance got to do with it?

It aims to help education authorities face the challenges of meeting the professional development needs of tomorrow's teachers in Europe and elsewhere. This report focuses on innovative and emergent practices of teacher Continuous Professional Development (CPD) and professional learning by teaching professionals who work in compulsory education. The first part of the study gathered an inventory of 30 examples illustrating new and innovative models and practices that have emerged to overcome the known barriers and limitations that teachers say hinder them today from participating in CPD. An accompanying Technical Report looks at their key elements and uses seven labels to describe and analyse the broad areas in which innovation currently takes place (Vuorikari, 2018). The labels are not categorical, and many of the examples feature many of them. This report further analyses the inventory of models and practices focusing on their innovative aspects. The 30 examples were classified according to their type of innovation representing product innovation as well as process, organisational and marketing innovation allowing for a discussion on the innovative aspects of the emergent practices in teacher professional development and professional learning. The key outcomes of the study are discussed in a cross-case analysis with the help of the above-mentioned seven broad areas. Lastly, together with providing conclusions, a number of policy pointers are given in order to better inspire and support those who plan and design policies and provision of teacher professional development and professional learning.", "published_on": "2019-02-12", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC115292", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC115292/jrc115292_innovating_pd_analysis_final_upload.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/26b251579883c5e1c7e592c60e918dd6.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/26b251579883c5e1c7e592c60e918dd6.png", "topics": ["Cognitive science", "Behavior modification", "Human communication", "Cognition", "ETwinning", "Policy", "School", "Leadership", "Experience", "Professional development", "Active learning", "Community", "Curriculum", "Peer learning", "Research", "Informal learning", "Collaboration", "Massive open online course", "Pedagogy", "Blended learning", "Learning", "Innovation", "Mentorship", "Educational technology", "Teacher", "Education", "Lesson plan", "Classroom", "Training", "Entrepreneurship", "Peer mentoring", "Internet", "Design thinking", "Cross-cultural communication", "Vocational education", "Teacher education", "Information", "Community of practice", "Knowledge", "Social media", "Analysis", "Team", "Expert", "Methodology", "Microlearning", "Academic degree", "European Union", "Tutoring", "Branches of science", "Best practice", "Online and offline", "Maker culture", "Hackerspace", "Inventory"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["education>school>higher education", "arts, culture and entertainment", "education", "science and technology", "arts, culture and entertainment>culture", "education>school>higher education>university", "education>school>further education", "education>school"], "source_tags": ["Information society"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/948518"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2760/734136", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264281820-7-en", "title": "PISA 2015 Context Questionnaires Framework", "journal": "PISA", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1080/09500690802535942", "title": "Improving Science and Mathematics Instruction: The SINUS Project as an example for reform as teacher professional development", "journal": "International Journal of Science Education", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1080/19415257.2016.1233507", "title": "\u2018I never feel alone in my classroom\u2019: teacher professional growth within a blended community of practice", "journal": "Professional Development in Education", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264094437-en", "title": "Inspired by Technology, Driven by Pedagogy", "journal": "Educational Research and Innovation", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.2791/90566", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.tate.2009.09.006", "title": "Impact of professional development on teacher practice: Uncovering connections", "journal": "Teaching and Teacher Education", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1787/2745d679-en", "title": "How can professional development enhance teachers\u2019 classroom practices?", "journal": "Teaching in Focus", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264311671-en", "title": "Measuring Innovation in Education 2019", "journal": "Educational Research and Innovation", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264215696-en", "title": "Measuring Innovation in Education", "journal": "Educational Research and Innovation", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264304604-en", "title": "Oslo Manual 2018", "journal": "The Measurement of Scientific, Technological and Innovation Activities", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1080/1475939x.2018.1528997", "title": "Who is taking MOOCs for teachers\u2019 professional development on the use of ICT?

As long as investment and operational costs are competitive against electricity prices, communities will have incentives to form and invest in the energy assets that better fit their demand and geographical conditions.

The report focuses on demography and climate mitigation through analyses of trajectories for emissions and population at global and EU levels. At the global level, the report highlights the role of population momentum. While population growth implies almost by definition higher emissions, at least in the short term, the intrinsic inertia in demographic processes implies that solutions to reduce emissions need to come from reducing inequalities, the greening of the economy and a change in consumption rather than from interventions on fertility. At the EU level, the report finds that although in absolute terms older people emit less, they have higher per capita emissions, a greater share of their emissions is concentrated in carbon-intensive consumption items and they are less likely to change their attitudes or behaviour towards more environmentally friendly patterns. Considering the trends for the ageing of the EU population...", "published_on": "2023-05-26", "added_on": "2023-06-09", "document_url":

Employment losses at the outset of the pandemic were sharper than those experienced during the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132010. Even greater declines in hours worked arose as a result of the widespread state-supported furloughing of workers. The physical distancing policies of governments led to another significant and largely ad hoc adjustment \u2013 the shift to mass remote working for those workers whose jobs allowed it.This report describes the employment and working time developments in the EU through the first year of the crisis and examines how they differed by sector and occupation. It explores the categories of workers who were most affected \u2013 primarily temporary workers, young workers and low-paid female workers. It also assesses the extent to which remote working served as a buffer during the crisis, preserving jobs that might otherwise have been lost.", "published_on": "2021-10-18", "added_on": "2022-12-19",

Substantially supported by DG AGRI, iMAP is constantly further developed to meet evolving policy needs. This report outlines iMAP\u2019s enhanced analytical capacity to capture the multidimensional aspects of SFS and assess policy impacts. Considerable progress has been made in capturing production and environmental aspects of policies and strategies, particularly those related to the European Green Deal (EGD). Significant developments have been achieved in integrating biophysical models, other sector-specific models, and satellite imagery data into iMAP\u2019s analytical framework. However, comprehensive modelling of environmental aspects of farming practices remains challenging due to the complex interplay of biological and agronomic factors, coupled with data limitations.

The objective of the scoreboard is to assess the EU\u2019s competitive position in climate-neutral solutions across important industrial ecosystems related to the energy transition. The previous assessment, the 2021 annual report, analysed 20 climate-neutral solutions, in the ecosystems of renewable energy, energy-intensive industry, mobility-transport-automotive, construction and electronics. This report provides an update of these 20 solutions and adds eight new climate-neutral solutions. The scoreboard is based on ten key indicators: public R&D investment, early and later stage private investment, patenting activity, number of innovating companies, employment, production, turnover, imports & exports and trade balance.

The military may also incur higher running costs for maintenance, repair or replacement of infrastructure and equipment and face increased health and safety risks from natural hazards and climate change (e.g. more hot days).Currently, only little information on natural hazard and climate change impacts on military infrastructure and operations in the EU exists or is publicly accessible.

This report focuses on innovative and emergent practices of teacher professional development and professional learning among teaching professionals who work in compulsory education.We set to look out for ways that have emerged to overcome the known barriers and limitations that teachers say hinder them today from participating in professional development activities. Our study gathers 30 examples that well illustrate new emergent features at a general level. The study is descriptive and it is based on desk research and a number of interviews. This report forms the first part of the study called Innovating Professional Development in Compulsory Education. It comprises the main data and documentation gathered for the study. The main results and analysis are reported elsewhere in a JRC Science for Policy report called \u201cInnovating Professional Development in Compulsory Education - An analysis of practices aimed at improving teacher PD\u201d (Vuorikari, 2019). After the Executive Summary, this report starts with an introduction (Section 2). Following that, a methodological note describes the steps taken for the whole study (Section 3). The main part, Section 4, describes the examples and groups them according to their focus of innovation. For that purpose, seven labels were created which are not categorical: School as a learning organisation; Empowering learners through competence-oriented approach; Innovating online delivery; Re-inventing blended learning; Engaging in first-hand experiences; Innovating degree programmes; and Innovating partnerships and new actors. A short concluding note is given in Section 5. Finally, the report also includes a number of in-depth case studies (Annex 2).", "published_on": "2018-12-18", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC109266", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC109266/jrc109266_teacherpd_techical_public.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/b4dd3a0519b347ae5d1ae30f0917f4d4.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/b4dd3a0519b347ae5d1ae30f0917f4d4.png", "topics": ["Cognition", "Behavior modification", "Human communication", "Active learning", "Analysis", "ETwinning", "Vocational education", "Lesson plan", "Teaching method", "Methodology", "Tutoring", "Curriculum", "Teacher education", "School", "Research question", "Pedagogy", "Blended learning", "Research", "Collaboration", "Learning", "Massive open online course", "Mentorship", "Educational technology", "Teacher", "Education", "Professional development", "Corporate social responsibility", "Literacy", "Cross-cultural communication", "Media literacy", "Innovation", "Adult education", "Expert", "Formative assessment", "Creativity", "Community", "Training", "Mathematics", "Cognitive science", "Reading", "Classroom", "Branches of science", "Learning theory (education)", "Experience", "Knowledge", "Entrepreneurship", "European Union", "Robotics", "Academic degree", "Action research", "Peer learning", "Moodle", "Lecture", "Hackerspace", "Peer mentoring", "Leadership"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["education", "education>school>higher education", "education>school", "science and technology", "education>school>higher education>university", "education>school>further education"], "source_tags": ["Information society"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/734136"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1007/bf03089703", "title": "Het Leerkracht Relatie Interview", "journal": "Kind en adolescent", "publisher": "Springer Nature"}, {"doi": "10.1016/s1479-3687(03)10001-6", "title": "1.

The technologies\nused were mRNA (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna)\nand viral vector carrier (AstraZeneca/Oxford). This\nrapid vaccine development was only possible because\nboth the mRNA and viral vector platforms had been\nstudied for many years so a solid basis of science\nwas available as a firm foundation on which to build\nthe new Covid-19 vaccines. The timescale for development\nwas compressed by using overlapping trials\nand rolling regulatory approval procedures. This represented\na step change in innovation for the sector.\nThe key breakthrough in mRNA science was made\nby Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman at the University\nof Pennsylvania in 2005 19 and their technology\nwas licensed to both BioNTech and Moderna for use\nin those companies\u2019 vaccines and other treatments.\nBeyond Covid, Moderna\u2019s new drug pipeline includes\nmRNA-based vaccines for Cancer, Influenza, Zika and\nothers together with mRNA treatments for cancer\nand autoimmune diseases.

The SEEA EA is also the reference framework under the proposal for the amendment of Regulation (EU) No 691/2011 on European environmental economic accounts.Building on previous work done within the MAES initiative, the EU-wide methodology presents useful insights to operationalise the SEEA EA at EU level by integrating different EU data streams in a consistent way with this global statistical standard to cons...", "published_on": "2022-09-28", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC130782", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC130782/JRC130782_01.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/2ad0f5c6c463a0c21b5304849c0e9bf8.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/2ad0f5c6c463a0c21b5304849c0e9bf8.png", "topics": ["Environmental conservation", "Physical geography", "Environmental social science", "Biogeochemistry", "Environmental science", "Systems ecology", "Nature", "Natural environment", "Earth sciences", "Wetland", "Socio-ecological system", "Restoration ecology", "Sustainability", "Grassland", "Human impact on the environment", "Habitat fragmentation", "Agriculture", "European Union", "Ecoregion", "System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting", "Copernicus Programme", "Soil", "Air pollution", "Air quality index", "Ecological resilience", "Ecosystem service", "Biodiversity", "Ecology", "Ecosystem", "Pollution", "Ecological classification", "Urban green space", "Time series", "Intensive farming", "Climate change", "Parameter", "Vegetation", "Forest", "Nature conservation", "Water", "Biogeography", "Tree", "Noise pollution", "Disturbance (ecology)", "Environmental degradation", "Earth phenomena", "Conservation biology", "Agroecosystem", "Environmental technology", "Habitat", "Sustainable Development Goals", "Environment", "Health", "Plant", "Riparian zone", "Natural resources", "Invasive species", "Branches of science", "Canopy (biology)", "Species", "European Environment Agency", "Natural resource management", "Top-down and bottom-up design"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["environment>natural resources", "environment>nature", "environment", "environment>nature>ecosystem", "environment>natural resources>water", "environment>environmental pollution", "science and technology"], "source_tags": ["Environment and climate change"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/13048", "9789276570295", "JRC130782", "EUR 31226 EN", "OP KJ-NA-31-226-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.10.024", "title": "Building relevant ecological indicators with basic data: Species and community specialization indices derived from atlas data", "journal": "Ecological Indicators", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1111/emr.12120", "title": "The effects of light and noise from urban development on biodiversity: Implications for protected areas in Australia", "journal": "Ecological Management and Restoration", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.05.004", "title": "Assessing habitat loss, fragmentation and ecological connectivity in Luxembourg to support spatial planning", "journal": "Landscape and Urban Planning", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.envsci.2014.08.006", "title": "Intercalibration of aquatic ecological assessment methods in the European Union: Lessons learned and way forward", "journal": "Environmental Science & Policy", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1111/geb.13371", "title": "Large\u2010scale drivers of relationships between soil microbial properties and organic carbon across Europe", "journal": "Global Ecology and Biogeography", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.10.023", "title": "Bird based Index of Biotic Integrity: Assessing the ecological condition of Atlantic Forest patches in human-modified landscape", "journal": "Ecological Indicators", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108397", "title": "Top ten birds indicators of high environmental quality in European cities", "journal": "Ecological Indicators", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.05.008", "title": "What lies beneath: Why knowledge of belowground biomass dynamics is crucial to effective seagrass management", "journal": "Ecological Indicators", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1002/fee.1747", "title": "Developing a standardized definition of ecosystem collapse for risk assessment", "journal": "Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.06.036", "title": "How do ecologists select and use indicator species to monitor ecological change?

ICT can be analysed from a dual perspective: as crucial in supporting sustainability strategies, and as responsible for environmental impacts related to energy and material use in their lifecycle.In order to facilitate policy-making, direct and indirect environmental impacts need to be assessed not just from a device perspective, but the overall system composed by interactions between users, devices and services. Making a reliable estimation of the energy and material savings potential is particularly challenging due to the uncertainty about future market developments, increased connectivity and multifunctionality, and behavioural changes.In 2016, the Commission announced, in the context of the Ecodesign Working Plan, a separate strand of work on ICT products in order to determine the best policy approach for improving their energy efficiency and wider circular economy aspects.

According to Emil Bj\u00f6rnson, an\nassociate professor at Link\u00f6ping University, (Clari et al, 2020) two fundamental aspects of 5G are an increase\nin the number of small cells and the rise of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas. The\nincreased number of small cells will logically imply higher energy consumption, but it has been pointed out\nthat the individual energy consumption of each small cell is much lower than in a conventional cell.\nConcerning massive MIMO, it involves the use of arrays with many more antennas at each base station, which\nrequires many more hardware components per base station and therefore more energy. A white paper\nreleased by Nokia (2016) base stations should be the subject of focus as they consume 80% of the energy\nused (only 15% of the energy is used to forward bits). Most of the energy is used for system broadcasts and\nrunning idle resources, to power fans and cooling systems (over 50% of the energy consumption), for heating"}]}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "engagement in the energy use of home devices and route optimisationin the field of transport.

Priority regions for buildings\u2019 renovation across the EU-27 are identified considering seismic risk, energy performance of buildings, and socioeconomic aspects. An integrated analysis framework is first presented along with primary metrics adopted for regional assessment. Metrics address loss of life, economic loss, space heating energy consumption and socioeconomic aspects. The framework uses a recent seismic exposure model, extended here to address both structural and energy building attributes. A wealth of open-access state-of-the-art data and models are employed in support of probabilistic risk assessment, machine learning, and composite indicators. The evaluated metrics are used to form indicators and prioritise regions based on seismic risk, energy performance and socioeconomic vulnerability, independently, resulting in different patterns of prioritisation.

The BEMPs provide inspirational examples for any organisation within the sector to improve its environmental performance.The report firstly outlines technical information on the contribution of car manufacturing and end-of-life vehicle (ELV) handling to key environmental burdens in the EU, alongside data on the economic relevance of the sector. The second chapter presents best environmental management p...", "published_on": "2018-01-08", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC109752", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC109752/jrc109752_20171201_final_formatted_best_practice_report_-_car_manufacturing_-_pubsy_final.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/2daa87a7214eaa8fce4bb49c20d18eb1.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/2daa87a7214eaa8fce4bb49c20d18eb1.png", "topics": ["Nature", "Economy", "Natural environment", "Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning", "European Union", "Sustainable design", "Best available technology", "Energy conservation", "Sustainability", "Performance indicator", "Supply chain", "Water footprint", "Best practice", "Recycling", "Benchmarking", "Cogeneration", "Environmental resource management", "Waste", "Greenhouse gas", "Eutrophication", "ISO 50001", "Energy management", "End of Life Vehicles Directive", "Life-cycle assessment", "Efficient energy use", "ISO 14000", "Eco-Management and Audit Scheme", "Manufacturing", "Fuel efficiency", "Water", "Car", "Air pollution", "Maintenance (technical)", "Fuel economy in automobiles", "Engine", "Technology", "Smog", "Lubricant", "European emission standards", "Sustainable energy", "Ecosystem", "Supply chain management", "Regulatory compliance", "Environmental impact assessment", "Acid rain", "Climate change", "Particulates", "Hybrid electric vehicle", "Carbon dioxide", "Human activities", "Automation", "Volatile organic compound", "Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals", "Waste minimisation", "Economy and the environment", "Natural gas", "Vehicle", "Pollution", "Central heating"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>energy and resource", "environment", "economy, business and finance>economy", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>chemicals"], "source_tags": ["Environment and climate change"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/202143", "9789279770708", "JRC109752", "EUR 28937 EN", "OP KJ-NA-28937-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2788/33972", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-41266-0_17", "title": "Modeling of Energy-Efficient Factories with Flow System Theory", "journal": "Trust Management III", "publisher": "Springer Berlin Heidelberg"}, {"doi": "10.2765/19388", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1525/tph.2015.37.2.124", "title": "Unearthing the War of 1812 The War of 1812: Official National Park Service Handbook .

The analysis addresses transport-related innovation from three different angles. It identifies the drivers and barriers to innovation for the main transport sub-sectors; it assesses quantitative indicators through the detailed analysis of the main industrial R&D investors and public R&D priorities in transport; and it identifies the key actors for transport research and knowledge flows between them in order to detect shortcomings in the current institutional set-up of transport innovation. The analysis finds that despite the significant on-going research efforts in transport, largely driven by the automotive industry, the potential for systemic innovations that go beyond modal boundaries and leave the currently pre-dominant design are under-exploited due to prominent lock-in effects caused by infrastructure and the institutional set-up of the innovation systems",

The present report uses the same methodology to study the EnPC markets of the EU during 2020-21. Ultimately, the report provides a set of recommendations of relevance for policy-making both at MS and EU levels. The report findings indicate a continued potential for the public and private sectors to engage with EnPCs.

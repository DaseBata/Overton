For example, US President Donald Trump's claims that a vaccine will be ready ahead of the US Presidential elections has further increased criticism over politics trumping science, The August 2020 announcement that Russia would launch a Covid-19 vaccine without the final Phase 3 testing sparked concern among vaccine scientists over its safety, and prompted the WHO to urge Russia to follow international guidelines for producing a vaccine against Covid-19. At the same time, a popular Italian meme, falsely claiming that Russian President Vladimir Putin had said that 'Pharmaceutical companies have asked us to delay the release of the vaccine! It's not about economics. Russia does not think about money when it comes to the lives of millions of people', appears to imply that criticism of the Russian vaccine could have a hidden agenda. Russian state TV claimed \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that it was 'several-fold more effective' than any 'foreign' vaccine. According to the Guardian, interactions on UK anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown Facebook posts increased from 12 000 in July 2020 to 42 000 in August, thus trebling in one month, sparking calls for action to counter conspiracy theories. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-russia-germany-idUSKCN2580K3 https://www.csis.org/analysis/risks-misinformation-and-vaccine-hesitancy-within-covid-19-crisis https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/leader-us-vaccine-push-says-he-ll-quit-if-politics-trumps-science-approval-process https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53735718 https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/novel-coronavirus-landscape-covid-19-(5).pdf?sfvrsn=ba27da1f_3&download=true https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02386-2 https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/sep/19/engagement-anti-vaccine-facebook-posts-trebles-one-month-coronavirus", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/sep/19/engagement-anti-vaccine-facebook-posts-trebles-one-month-coronavirus", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/31/madonna-takes-on-new-role-as-covid-19-conspiracy-theorist", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/31/madonna-takes-on-new-role-as-covid-19-conspiracy-theorist", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/18/van-morrison-fascist-bullies-anti-lockdown-covid-songs", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/18/van-morrison-fascist-bullies-anti-lockdown-covid-songs", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Right-wing online platform Breitbart news posted a video on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in July 2020.

This can be accomplished by leveraging various agencies, like the US International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) list. Lists differ substantially from each other and cover more than half of the world.

The final section offers a number of policy recommendations, highlighting five interrelated \u2018lines of effort\u2019 essential to maximising the efficiency and effectiveness of counter-terrorism and countering violent extremism strategic communication.", "published_on": false, "added_on": "2022-12-07", "document_url": "https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/IPOL_STU(2017)596829", "pdf_url": "https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/596829/IPOL_STU(2017)596829_EN.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/euparl_library/326da034b858f5f60a8d323925e7a719.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/euparl_library/326da034b858f5f60a8d323925e7a719.png", "topics": ["Politics", "Public sphere", "Human activities", "Culture", "Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant", "Internet", "Advertising campaign", "Strategic communication", "Counter-terrorism", "Terrorism", "Global Counterterrorism Forum", "Institute for Strategic Dialogue", "International Centre for Counter-Terrorism", "European Union", "Target audience", "Advertising", "Social media", "Europol", "Violent extremism", "Government", "Communication", "Radicalization", "Psychological concepts", "Propaganda", "Jigsaw (company)"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "crime, law and justice", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>media", "science and technology", "society", "politics", "crime, law and justice>crime", "conflicts, war and peace", "society>values"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": [], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1080/1057610x.2013.784568", "title": "Options and Strategies for Countering Online Radicalization in the United States", "journal": "Studies in Conflict & Terrorism", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1080/09546553.2017.1339695", "title": "Navigating ISIS\u2019s Preferred Platform: Telegram1", "journal": "Terrorism and Political Violence", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1111/1745-9133.12249", "title": "Terrorist Use of the Internet by the Numbers", "journal": "Criminology & Public Policy", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.19165/2017.1.08", "title": "Losing the Plot: Narrative, Counter-Narrative and Violent Extremism", "journal": "Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism Studies", "publisher": "The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism (ICCT)"}, {"doi": "10.1080/03071847.2013.847714", "title": "Pathways to Violent Extremism in the Digital Era", "journal": "The RUSI Journal", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1080/1057610x.2016.1212551", "title": "An Analysis of Inspire and Dabiq: Lessons from AQAP and Islamic State's Propaganda War", "journal": "Studies in Conflict & Terrorism", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.19165/2016.1.05", "title": "Making CVE Work: A Focused Approach Based on Process Disruption", "journal": "Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism Studies", "publisher": "The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism (ICCT)"}, {"doi": "10.1080/21689725.2017.1349618", "title": "The new voice of America: Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act", "journal": "First Amendment Studies", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.19165/2016.2.06", "title": "A \u201cLinkage-Based\u201d Approach to Combating Militant Islamist Propaganda: A Two-Tiered Framework for Practitioners", "journal": "Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism Studies", "publisher": "The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism (ICCT)"}], "policy": [{"overton_id": "randcorporation-52e1757ce7b7916bc76090d074354493", "title": "Radicalization in the Digital Era", "policy_source_id": "randcorporation"}, {"overton_id": "eucommission-22b084c1d2a6c015459e5fdc9ef14f89", "title": "An effective and genuine Security Union", "policy_source_id": "eucommission"}, {"overton_id": "isdglobal-9ff10eedc267fd087ffbef5cecddfa21", "title": "The Counter-narrative Handbook - ISD", "policy_source_id": "isdglobal"}, {"overton_id": "governmentofmalaysia-0ea3371b460b2e40bc1b6129509d2282", "title": "Malaysia \u2019 S Policy On Counter Terrorism", "policy_source_id": "governmentofmalaysia"}, {"overton_id": "osce-59a8898675e7a31ed8571b3f6914dfef", "title": "Draft Annotated Agenda", "policy_source_id": "osce"}, {"overton_id": "osce-b5d0a4b63df9294c286fb5c483b0d803", "title": "Permanent Council Decision No. 1063", "policy_source_id": "osce"}], "news": [{"reference_string": "132 Alexander Babuta, \u201cOnline Radicalisation: The need for an Offline Response,\u201d RUSI, 25 September, 2015, https://rusi.org/commentary/online-radicalisation-need-offline-response;

The review shows that dielectric heating can occur at all considered frequencies (0.4-300 GHz) and for all studied organisms.

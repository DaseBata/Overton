It begins with a short summary of what influences users\u2019 engagement in ride-sharing for conventional vehicles, followed by the factors that affect user acceptance and trust of robotic systems. Using studies of human robot interaction (HRI), recommendations are made on how to improve users\u2019 trust, acceptance and use of shared AVs. Results from real-world studies and on-line surveys provide some contradictory views regarding willingness to accept and use the systems, which may be partly due to the fact that on-line users have not had actual interactions with AVs. We recommend that the pathway to adoption and acceptance of AVs should be incremental and iterative, providing users with hands-on experience of the systems at every stage. This removes unrealistic, idealised, expectations, which can ultimately hamper acceptance.

Diese Megatrends bilden sich langsam aus. Sobald sie aber an Fahrt gewonnen haben, \u00fcben sie einen tiefgreifenden und anhaltenden Einfluss auf menschliche Handlungen, Prozesse und Wahrnehmungen aus. Auch der Tourismus ist entsprechend betroffen. Es gibt vier Megatrends, die sich wahrscheinlich erheblich auf den Tourismus auswirken werden und entsprechend relevant sind: i) die sich wandelnde Besuchernachfrage; ii) nachhaltiges Wachstum des Tourismus; iii) Basistechnologien (\u00abenabling technologies\u00bb) sowie iv) Reisemobilit\u00e4t.

They provide not just jobs but a whole range of public, cultural, social and consumption amenities. Transport is what connects people to these opportunities and cities provide access with varying degrees of success \u2013 especially when it comes to modes of transport that favour a green transition. This report argues that building sustainable transport networks for accessible cities requires a holistic planning approach, a sound institutional framework, reliable sources of funding, strong governmental capacity, and should build on community engagement. Urban accessibility requires coherent allocation of responsibilities across levels of government to support strategic planning. The report proposes concrete actions that cities can take to adapt their institutional framework, to improve transport planning and ensure they have access to sustainable sources of funding to implement their plans.", "published_on": "2020-12-11", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/fcb2eae0-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail":

In terms of economics, the welfare effects of zero rating on consumers can be favourable or unfavourable. While case by case analyses are almost indispensable, the different approaches which regulators and policy makers around the world are taking to zero rating exhibits substantial variation. Nevertheless, it is desirable that regulators and policy makers are alive to both the benefits and the risks associated with zero rating practices, and that in deciding their approach they have regard

It discusses how digitalisation has changed international trade and provides estimates of the impact of increased digital connectivity on trade. It shows that digitalisation is particularly important for trade in more complex manufactures and digitally deliverable services; that it helps parties better exploit benefits from trade agreements; and that it gives rise to new complementarities between goods and services. The paper also discusses some trade-related regulatory challenges. Engaging in digital trade in goods means paying attention to a broader range of supporting services, such as logistics or e-payments. Similarly, the ability to engage in trade in services, particularly those that are digitally delivered, is also, in part, affected by market access in ICT goods.

Decarbonising transport lies at the core of efforts to mitigate climate change and has close links to urban sustainability and housing affordability. The report identifies the drivers of rising emissions in the urban transport sector and offers pathways to reduce them through a combination of transport and land use policies. The analysis yields a holistic welfare evaluation of these policies, assessing them according to their environmental effectiveness, their economic efficiency and their impact on fiscal balance and housing affordability. The report concludes that significant reductions in emissions from urban transport can be achieved through a careful alignment of transport policies designed to promote the use of public transit and electric vehicles, and land use policies, which foster a more compact urban form.

The report finds significant disparities in the content, process and transformative value of the RRPs among these countries. The differences in the content of the national RRPs, and the ability and willingness to seize the opportunity presented by the RRPs to drive transformation, are explained by existing national policy contexts and frameworks. Surprisingly, the role of R&amp;I policy in the RRPs is less important than expected, despite its emphasised importance in literature and political rhetoric.

Central to this are recent research efforts that embrace accountability\u2019s foundations as a relational exchange of accounts.

Much of that support is provided by governments through the financial system, either in the form of below\u2011market borrowings or below-market equity. To better understand the nature and scale of this support, this report uses publicly available information for 306 of the largest manufacturing firms in 13 industrial sectors, covering the period 2005-19. It finds that below-market borrowings tend to be relatively large in heavy industries, including some that reportedly suffer from excess capacity, while below-market equity returns appear to be more common in high-tech industries such as aerospace and semiconductors. Below-market borrowings also appear to benefit firms with more than 25% government investment relatively more. These findings on below-market finance raise a number of important issues for trade rules, including in relation to transparency and the scope of subsidy disciplines.", "published_on": "2021-05-12", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/a1a5aa8a-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/e92d9c46d7018b3dba915d2053a308d7.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/e92d9c46d7018b3dba915d2053a308d7.png", "topics": ["Money", "Equity (finance)", "Debt", "Finance", "Cost of capital", "Beta (finance)", "Trade", "Business", "Economy", "Funding", "Risk premium", "Discounted cash flow", "Tax", "Bank", "Investment", "Interest rate", "Investor", "Stock", "Subsidy", "Capital asset pricing model", "Interest", "Loan", "Credit", "Valuation (finance)", "Profit (economics)", "Risk", "Guarantee", "Rate of return", "Market (economics)", "Bond (finance)", "State-owned enterprise", "Corporations", "Productivity", "OECD", "Asset", "Environmental, social and corporate governance", "Economics"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>financial and business service", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics", "economy, business and finance>market and exchange", "economy, business and finance>market and exchange>loan market", "economy, business and finance>business information", "economy, business and finance>business information>human resources", "economy, business and finance>economy", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>financial and business service>banking", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics>credit and debt", "economy, business and finance>market and exchange>loan market>loans", "economy, business and finance>business information>human resources>management"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Working paper", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/a1a5aa8a-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.3386/w13103", "title": "Das (Wasted) Kapital: Firm Ownership and Investment Efficiency in China", "publisher": "National Bureau of Economic Research"}, {"doi": "10.1787/df226cbd-en", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264163577-en", "title": "Spotlight on Public Support to Industry", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/cb8ca170-en", "title": "Government support and the COVID-19 pandemic", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/63629cc9-en", "title": "The Best versus the Rest", "journal": "OECD Productivity Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/2a8ad9cd-en", "title": "State enterprises in the steel sector", "journal": "OECD Science, Technology and Industry Policy Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/weo-2018-en", "title": "World Energy Outlook 2018", "journal": "World Energy Outlook 2017", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1016/s0304-405x(01)00044-7", "title": "The theory and practice of corporate finance: evidence from the field", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1257/aer.98.5.1943", "title": "Zombie Lending and Depressed Restructuring in Japan", "journal": "American Economic Review", "publisher": "American Economic Association"}, {"doi": "10.1257/aer.20160034", "title": "Some Causal Effects of an Industrial Policy", "journal": "American Economic Review", "publisher": "American Economic Association"}, {"doi": "10.1111/1468-0327.12034", "title": "Evaluating the cost of government credit support: the OECD context", "journal": "Economic Policy", "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}, {"doi": "10.1111/j.1467-6435.1986.tb01252.x", "title": "The Soft Budget Constraint", "journal": "Kyklos", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1039/c3ee40701b", "title": "Assessing the drivers of regional trends in solar photovoltaic manufacturing", "journal": "Energy Environ.

Fernandez et al. (2019[68]) provide survey responses about the required risk premium in several countries, and have found higher values for China than those used in this study.

Making the regulatory framework more predictable and flexible would help to strengthen economic resilience. Strict regulations limit the entry of new firms, shielding incumbents from internal and external competition. Ensuring a rules-based, level-playing field for firms requires enforcing rules without exemptions. More flexible labour markets would create more high-quality formal jobs but should be accompanied by a comprehensive reform programme that shifts job loss protection to a broader-based unemployment insurance scheme and well-designed activation policies.

Incentivise and plan for a significantly more distributed, flexible and interconnected Nordic electricity system. A decentralised electricity supply with a high share of wind is likely to achieve a carbon-neutral system at lower cost than a system reliant on nuclear and thermal generation. But the shift will require flexibility measures beyond those now provided by Nordic hydropower, as well as a significant increase in cross-border electricity trade.2.

The world is in the middle of an urbanisation process that will cause urbanisation rates to rise from low double digit rates to more than 80% by the end of the century.

Consisting of three parts, the report discusses the need for systems thinking in the public sector; identifies tactics that can be employed by government agencies to work towards systems change; and provides an in-depth examination of how systems approaches have been applied in practice. Four cases of applied systems approaches are presented and analysed: preventing domestic violence (Iceland), protecting children (the Netherlands), regulating the sharing economy (Canada) and designing a policy framework to conduct experiments in government (Finland).

While there has been a remarkable decline in inequality in OECD countries, inequality among regions within certain countries has increased over the same time period. Regions that narrowed productivity gaps tended to benefit from economically vibrant tradable sectors and integration with well-functioning cities. This report considers in detail the role of the tradable sector as a driver of productivity growth and its relationship with employment. It addresses the possible risks of a growing tradable sector and how diversification is central to strengthening regional economic resilience. It considers how regions integrate global value chains and highlights the role of regional and policy links in fostering productivity growth and job creation.

As the share of the world\u2019s population living in cities rises, ambitious action in urban areas can be instrumental in achieving long\u2011term sustainability of the global energy system \u2013 including the carbon emission reductions required to meet the climate goals reached at COP21 in Paris. Support from national governments is a strategic prerequisite for leveraging the potential for sustainable energy technology and policy in cities that too often lies untapped.With global energy demand set to become even greater over the coming decades, Energy Technology Perspectives 2016 (ETP 2016) looks at the technology and policy opportunities available for accelerating the transition to sustainable urban energy systems. Such potential could be the key to successfully driving an energy transition that many still think impossible, provided that local and national actions can be aligned to meet the sustainability objectives at both levels.

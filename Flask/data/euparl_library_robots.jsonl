It has wide-ranging social and economic consequences for those living with the condition, their families and carers, and society as a whole. The Council's conclusions of December 2015 acknowledge the importance of this challenge. Dementia is not one specific disease, but an overall term for a syndrome that affects memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning capacity, language and judgement. There are many different causes and forms of dementia. The condition remains little understood, and there is currently no cure. Action to tackle dementia is centred on its prevention, early detection and timely diagnosis, and on improving the quality of life of those living with it through care and support. Research focuses on the causes and possible treatments, on better care and prevention, as well as on developing assistive technologies.

safety (3E + S). For this purpose and in spite of being the only country to have suffered the devastating effects of nuclear weapons in a time of war, it has developed a nuclear energy capacity that reached 46-47 gigawatt (GW) between 2005 and 2010, making it the thirdlargest user of nuclear energy, which covered 30 % of its electricity needs at that time and was poised to reach 40 % in 2017. The 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, triggered by the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami, blocked this development, as public opposition to nuclear energy became the predominant sentiment and the focus was shifted to averting accident-related risks. Consequently, all of Japan's nuclear plants were closed or had their operations suspended for safety inspections. Furthermore, fossil fuels increased in relevance: in 2019 they accounted for 88 % of total primary energy supply (TPES), the sixth-highest share among IEA (International Energy Agency) countries. By comparison, fossil fuels in the EU accounted for 71.2 % of TPES in 2018. Fukushima had an impact in the EU too: nuclear power plants stress tests were conducted, Belgium and Germany decided to phase out nuclear power, while the Italian government's intention to reintroduce nuclear energy in the country was rejected by a referendum. https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/japan-nuclear-power.aspx

Despite their common attachment to human rights and a potential affinity of seemingly common transatlantic approaches to human rights issues in external policies, the EU and the US have diverged considerably in their respective promotion of human rights abroad. Drawing on the historical and legal underpinnings of human rights promotion in the EU and the US, the purpose of the present study is to provide a comparative analysis of how human rights are integrated and mainstreamed into their respective external policies, thereby using case studies such as EU Special Representatives/US Special Envoys, Democracy Promotion, the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court to contextualise the argument.

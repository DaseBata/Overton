This impact can be reduced in a number of ways, by using luminaire and light source combinations with a high luminous efficacy, by dimming during periods of low road use and by selection of the lowest necessary light class for roads to prevent unnecessary over-lighting in the first place.Light pollution is another environmental impact of particular relevance to road lighting and traffic signals which is not well addressed by LCA methodologies.

In addition to pharmaceutical applications, flow chemistry is expanding into organometallic chemistry, fine chemicals, polymers, peptides, nanomaterials, and energetic materials synthesis.In Chapter 2 of this report, we review the principles of flow chemistry, and highlight the potential benefits compared to performing reactions in batch mode. For example, flow reactors facilitate the fast dissipation of heat created during highly exothermic reactions, such as mixing of sulfuric-nitric acid, nitration reactions, or possible side reactions such as oxidation of nitro-aromatic compounds. Heat transfer rate in flow reactors can be magnitudes of orders faster than in a batch reactor and this prevents the hot-spot generation that can stimulate side reactions or runaway reactions to occur.

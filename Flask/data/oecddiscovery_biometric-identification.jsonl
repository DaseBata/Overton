In addition, the dominant lethal test is relevant to assessing genotoxicity because, although they may vary among species, factors of in vivo metabolism, pharmacokinetics and DNA-repair processes are active and contribute to the response. Induction of a DL mutation after exposure to a test chemical indicates that the chemical has affected germinal tissue of the test animal.This modified version of the Test Guideline reflects more than thirty years of experience with this test and the potential for integrating or combining this test with other toxicity tests such as developmental, reproductive toxicity, or genotoxicity studies; however due to its limitations and the use of a large number of animals this assay is not intended for use as a primary method, but rather as a supplemental test method which can only be used when there is no alternative for re...", "published_on": "2015-07-28", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264243118-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/03f4e7783c58a70fa790abc1c6ea3736.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/03f4e7783c58a70fa790abc1c6ea3736.png", "topics": ["Toxicity", "Overdispersion", "Dose (biochemistry)", "Genotoxicity", "Germ cell", "Poisson regression", "Resampling (statistics)", "Poisson distribution"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["science and technology>natural science", "economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "science and technology>natural science>biology", "science and technology>natural science>biology>genetics", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>chemicals", "health"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/9789264243118-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1787/9789264078376-en", "title": "Guidance Document on the Recognition, Assessment and Use of Clinical Signs as Human Endpoints for Experimental Animals Used in Safety Evaluation", "journal": "OECD Series on Testing and Assessment", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1007/bf00368226", "title": "Standard protocol for the dominant lethal test on male mice set up by the work group ?dominant lethal mutations of the ad hoc Committee Chemogenetics?", "journal": "Archives of Toxicology", "publisher": "Springer Nature America, Inc"}, {"doi": "10.1016/b978-0-444-80519-5.50027-4", "title": "THE DOMINANT LETHAL ASSAY IN THE MALE MOUSE", "publisher": "Elsevier"}, {"doi": "10.1016/s1383-5718(98)00091-6", "title": "Recommendations for statistical designs of in vivo mutagenicity tests with regard to subsequent statistical analysis", "journal": "Mutation Research/Genetic Toxicology and Environmental Mutagenesis", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1093/mutage/7.5.313", "title": "REPORT OF BRITISH TOXICOLOGY SOCIETY/UK ENVIRONMENTAL MUTAGEN SOCIETY WORKING GROUP", "journal": "Mutagenesis", "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}, {"doi": "10.1016/s0027-5107(97)00197-8", "title": "A comparison of male-mediated effects in rats and mice exposed to 1,3-butadiene", "journal": "Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1093/toxsci/3.2.80", "title": "Ethylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether II.

At the same time, Peru is going through a demographic and epidemiological transition, with an increasing disease burden from non-communicable diseases, with significant increases in cancer, CVD and diabetes, especially in urban areas. Measuring how the Peruvian health system is responding to these challenges requires a solid set of health sector statistics and indicators, underpinned by a robust health information system. The breadth and depth of data must be relevant and applicable to decision making at all levels of the health system, both to respond to national policy needs as well as comparing Peru in a regional and global context. This report assesses the status and availability of Peru\u2019s routinely reported health sector data and statistics as well as the underlying data infrastructure.

It asserts that despite challenges some countries are facing in guaranteeing women equal access to economic opportunity, progress is underway and can be further nurtured through targeted, inclusive and coordinated policy actions. Building on the conclusions of a first monitoring report released in 2017, the report analyses recent legislative, policy and institutional reforms in support of women\u2019s economic empowerment in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia and seeks to identify success factors that have helped anchor reform. Moreover, it delivers actionable examples and practical tools for policy makers to help them transform policies into effective actions for women\u2019s economic empowerment.", "published_on":

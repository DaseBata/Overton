Finally, the Kroc Institute identifies strategic accord commitments that can create positive cascades and have the capacity to increase implementation levels for each point of the Agreement. Evaluating implementation of the Colombian Final Agreement five years after its signing is a significant task. As stipulated in section 6.3.2 of the Final Agreement, the Kroc Institute has the mandate to provide technical assistance to the International Verification Component (CIV) and the Commission for Monitoring, Promoting, and Verifying the Implementation of the Final Agreement (CSIVI).

Autonomous vehicles are very complex cyber physical systems composed by many inter-connected components like sensors, actuators and artificial intelligence processors. They are supposed to operate with high accuracy and safety with limited presence of human drivers or completely in their absence (i.e., driverless cars). In addition, they are supposed to be robust against unintentional or intentional malfunctions, which can be caused by cybersecurity threats as vehicles will be increasingly connected, which can be exploited by cybersecurity attackers. The report reviews the existing activities at global and european level for testing and certification of autonomous vehicles with a particular focus on the current revision of the UNECE regulatory framework.Then, the report focuses on three separate elements of testing of automated vehicles: a) definition of processes for cybersecurity testing and mitigation of cybersecurity threats, b) testing and evaluation of artificial intelligence components of the automated vehicles and c) definition of database scenarios and languages for testing of automated vehicles. These areas have been selected because they address gaps in the policy support analysis needed by DG GROW C.4.On each of these areas, the report identifies key recommendations at regulatory and

This combined seminar and training event was the first time that all EU and EU-affiliated competent authorities met all together to share perspectives on Seveso Directive (and equivalent) implementation, to identify areas of common concern and to seek opportunities for mutual support. The main purpose of the event was to exchange on common challenges in Seveso implementation and to give training to competent authorities on newly available JRC tools for assessing consequences and risks associated with chemical and Natech accidents.

The level of online security is affected by technical factors, natural events and human behaviour.

It tests several warning messages, based on behavioural insights, which could persuade consumers to behave more securely while online, thus diminishing their chances of suffering a cyber-attack. MethodsA lab experiment was conducted in Spain (n=600). Participants had to make some online shopping decisions, and were assigned a quantity of money.

It highlights the importance of promoting data security and privacy both for economic growth and social enhancement, and underlines the role of encryption in ensuring the free flow of data in the digital single market. DigitalEurope also states that national governments should avoid technology mandates and backdoors, which will \u2018impede innovation, hurt the economy, and weaken data security and privacy\u2019. This point of view is shared by ENISA, the European Union Agency for Network and Information. In its Opinion Paper on Encryption (2016) [Enisa encryption], one of the key messages is that \u2018law enforcement solutions need to be identified without the use of backdoors and key escrow\u2019, since \u2018limiting the use of cryptographic tools will create vulnerabilities that can in turn be used by terrorists and criminals, and lower trust in electronic services, which will eventually damage industry and civil society in the EU\u2019. On the issue also the European Data Protection Supervisor gave his Opinion on the review of the e-Privacy Directive [EC e-privacy 2017], stating that \u2018the new rules should also clearly allow users to use end-to-end encryption (without \u2018back-doors\u2019) to protect their electronic communications. Decryption, reverse engineering or monitoring of communications protected by encryption should be prohibited\u2019 [EDPS 2016], a position which seems to clash with the desires of some Member States\u2019 governments [The Guardian Jun 2017]. http://www.digitaleurope.org/DesktopModules/Bring2mind/DMX/Download.aspx?Command=Core_Download&EntryId=2241&language=en-US&PortalId=0&TabId=353https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisas-opinion-paper-on-encryptionhttps://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-privacy-and-electronic-communications;https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/16-07-22_opinion_eprivacy_en.pdf https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/19/eu-outlaw-backdoors-new-data-privacy-proposals-uk-government-encrypted-communications-whatsapp", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/19/eu-outlaw-backdoors-new-data-privacy-proposals-uk-government-encrypted-communications-whatsapp", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2016/apr/16/justin-trudeau-and-quantum-computers", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2016/apr/16/justin-trudeau-and-quantum-computers", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "[Politico 2017] https://www.politico.eu/article/huawei-china-ghost-in-europe-telecom-machine", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/huawei-china-ghost-in-europe-telecom-machine", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "[The Economist China 2017] \u2018Quantum Cryptography in space: The early bird\u2019, The Economist, 2 September 2017, https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21727889-quantumcryptographys-early-birds-first-quantum-cryptographic-satellite", "matched_news_url": "https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21727889-quantumcryptographys-early-birds-first-quantum-cryptographic-satellite", "matched_news_outlet": "The Economist"}, {"reference_string": "[Moore 2014] Moore, M.

Often countries themselves re-orientate their strategies and internationalisation of their S&T policies according to emerging competitiveness and economic challenges. To obtain better insights into current S&T cooperation of Europe with the US, a questionnaire has been circulated to the delegates of the Strategic Forum for International S&T Cooperation (SFIC) in 2010. This aimed at providing an overview of their S&T cooperation policies, their dynamics, government strategies and related experiences in S&T cooperation with the US. Based on analysis of questionnaire responses, this report provides a short assessment of the status of public S&T cooperation. The analysis draws on 26 completed questionnaires covering 22 MS and 4 associated countries to FP7 (i.e. SFIC observer countries) and an additional questionnaire representing activities of the European Commission. As agreed by the SFIC Task Force on Priority Setting this report presents a simple analysis of the data received, without introducing additional elements/analytical processes such as comparative analysis using input-output indicators or benchmarking. Report summarizes the main findings in S&T cooperation with the US from a comparative perspective.

Research and Innovation is crucial to achieve EU transport safety and resilience objectives. Projects funded by the European Framework Programmes perform the background analysis and develop the technologies and the means for safety and resilience management. They also propose improvements for regulations and conceive procedures for their enforcement. Finally, they provide insights on human behaviour and develop innovative training to raise awareness and promote a safety culture. EU research and innovation therefore addresses all three pillars of safety and resilience: technologies, regulations and human factors, in a collaborative and inclusive framework.

More jobs and growth are expected from investments in KETs, hoping they may lead to a more prosperous society through higher skills and wages, while expanding innovative high technology exports globally. Consequently, KETs, especially the five ICT KETs examined in the following chapters, should be seen as having a strategic social importance. The initiative will catalyse not only product innovation but also the industrial process.

The sample was stratified in terms of age, gender, regions, place of residence (rural vs. urban) and education level. Participants made a number of choices between pairs of food products across a wide range of food categories. We varied the mode of display of some of the food information: it was either available directly (\u201cpaper label\u201d) or only after the participants clicked on a QR code (\u201chybrid label\u201d).

Up to now concentrating solar technologies have developed to a commercial scale but have played only a small role in decarbonising the energy system. Nonetheless considerable potential exists in globally and in the EU. The development of the market relies on the design of effective auctions which can potentially reward the flexibility that the technology provides.

In a world characterised by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, there is a growing need for evidence-informed policy-making. Drawing on a mixed-method approach, we carried out an assessment of the science for policy system in Portugal, with a focus on five selected fields (Defence, Economy, Employment, Environment, and Health). While there is a diverse set of organisational mechanisms for scientific advice in Portugal, it was found that there is not a single science for policy ecosystem. Policymaking bodies are not fully aware of the relevance of scientific advice, and there is a lack of formalisation of the procedures followed.

While CSP has developed to a commercial scale, it has played a small role in decarbonizing the energy system, and the global market growth remains modest. The EU's progress in adding CSP capacity has also been slow, and effective auctions are needed to reward the technology's supply flexibility. Further standardization in design and manufacturing, R&D investment, and digitization are essential for CSP to become more cost-competitive and attract the needed investment to increase deployment rates. EU companies face strong competition from China, and access to favourable project financing may be equally important to technical prowess.

The market for deep geothermal energy is growing globally and, while the EU is underrepresented in drilling services, it has a strong manufacturing base for both above- and below-ground equipment. Despite the potential for this technology, it still faces challenges, such as high upfront costs, limited subsurface data availability, and licensing issues. Geothermal operations also have varying environmental impacts and may affect public acceptance. However, geothermal energy has a high potential to supply the EU's district heating and cooling sector.

In doing so, it paves the way for the introduction of electronic tools, with a view to reduce the administrative burden whilst rendering the documents less prone to tampering.

In 2011, therefore, the JRC launched the first comprehensive inventory of smart grid projects in Europe to collect lessons learned and assess current developments.The participation of project coordinators and the reception of the report by the smart grid community were extremely positive. It was therefore decided that the project inventory would be carried out on a regular basis so as to constantly update the picture of smart grid developments. This study is the 2013-2014 update of the inventory started out in 2011.The JRC\u2019s 2013-14 Smart Grid database contains 459 smart grid R&D and D&D projects from all 28 European Union countries.

In spite of these, the summaries received have revealed several challenges related to the process and the content of the assessments. The current report aims to provide scientific support to the UCPM participant countries in their development of NRA, explaining why and how a risk assessment could be carried out, how the results of this could be used for Disaster Risk Management planning and in general, how science can help civil protection authorities and staff from ministries and agencies engaged in NRA activities.

Asfirst priority, solid hydrogen supply chains are needed, together with carbon capture technologies aimed to buildCarbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) systems. Fuels that may be produced starting from H2 and CO2 or N2 arehydrocarbons, alcohols and ammonia. The use of RFNBO is crucial in the transition towards full decarbonisationon account of their ability to be used in the existing fuel infrastructures.

It is expected that CCAM unveils new and unprecedented mobility opportunities that hold the potential to unlock a range of safety, environmental and efficiency benefits. At the same time, it is anticipated that it will bring deep changes in the labour market, progressively making some occupations and skills less relevant, while at the same time opening up new opportunities for different businesses and requiring new and more advanced skills. With Europe accounting for 23% of global motor vehicle production (Acea Statistics, 2016) and almost 72% of inland freight transported by road in Europe (European Commission, 2017a), the full deployment of Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) technologies is expected to have a substantial impact on the European economy.

It proved equally challenging to account for current examples of governance arrangements providing joint assistance to population, businesses, and services across borders in Europe. The study makes an effort to provide first a conceptual framework for defining cross-border impacts, building on existing classifications of interdependencies and types of impacts available in literature. It then illustrates risk assessment and management methods and discusses the need to complement the latter with a resilience approach.

We present a step by step assessment framework based on the work performed by EPRI (Electric Power Research Institute) on cost-benefit analysis and provide methodological guidelines and best practices. Modifications to fit the European context have been proposed wherever necessary. This work draws on the existing collaboration between the European Commission (EC) and the US Department of Energy in the framework of the EU-US Energy Council. A European Smart Grid project has been selected from the JRC catalogue and used as a case study to test and illustrate the proposed assessment framework. The analysis is supported by a thorough reference to existing literature on cost-benefit analysis and on concrete results of available cost-benefit analysis carried out on the field. On the basis of this exercise, we provide guidelines to tailor assumptions to local conditions, to identify and monetize benefits and costs, and to perform sensitivity analysis of most critical variables. The report also discusses the identification of indirect benefits (externalities) and social impacts that can result out of the implementation of Smart Grid projects but that cannot be easily monetized and factored in the cost-benefit computation.", "published_on": "2012-04-27", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC67964", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC67964/2012.2783-jrc_rr_cba_for_smart_grids_%28online%29.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/0fe006c6d0b84aa08dd758be1247da17.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/0fe006c6d0b84aa08dd758be1247da17.png", "topics": ["Economy", "Economics of climate change mitigation", "Consumption (economics)", "Electrical substation", "Discounted cash flow", "Uncertainty", "Electric power distribution", "Peak demand", "Internal rate of return", "Economic growth", "Smart meter", "Net present value", "Sensitivity analysis", "Demand response", "Electric power transmission", "Electrical grid", "Ancillary services (electric power)", "Smart grid", "Cost\u2013benefit analysis", "Demand", "Energy", "Externality", "Real estate appraisal", "Maintenance (technical)", "Efficient energy use", "Power factor", "Load profile", "Economics", "Risk", "Power outage", "Business", "Interest rate", "International Energy Agency", "Electricity pricing", "Kilowatt-hour", "Performance indicator", "Investment", "Supply chain", "Discounting", "Parameter", "Distributed generation"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economy", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology"], "source_tags": ["Economic and monetary Union", "Energy and transport", "Nuclear safety and security", "Safety and security"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2790/4586", "10.2790/45979"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1109/ptc.2009.5281852", "title": "Sustainability analysis of VSC-HVDC in the liberalised European power system: A practical case", "publisher": "IEEE"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.enpol.2010.12.025", "title": "An estimate of the value of lost load for Ireland", "journal": "Energy Policy", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.enpol.2011.05.024", "title": "Smart grids: Another step towards competition, energy security and climate change objectives", "journal": "Energy Policy", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.eneco.2006.05.022", "title": "The value of supply security", "journal": "Energy Economics", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.2790/32946", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2790/20638", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.enpol.2011.07.030", "title": "Uncertainties in smart grids behavior and modeling: What are the risks and vulnerabilities?

As first, well-established solid hydrogen supply chains are needed, together with carbon capture technologies for Carbon Capture and Use (CCU). Fuels that may be produced starting from H2 and CO2 or N2 are hydrocarbons, alcohols and ammonia. The use of RFNBO is crucial in the transition period towards the electrification for their ability to be used in the existing fuel infrastructures, so many funding programmes is today available.

The year proved relatively quiet concerning drought events in Europe; the subcontinent was only affected in the Baltics, although fires broke out vigorously in the Balkans, Spain and Russia. Thanks to the recent juvenile concern with regard to the heating up of the climate, drought events and forest fires drew more public-attention. Our reaction upon this concern in the Global Drought Observatory is the development of a new group of data, which we call Drought Mitigation. With more people genuinely concerned in the effect of our alternation of the properties of the lower atmosphere, we take up the task to provide guidelines for repair and adaptation. Higher temperatures imply that air depletes more vapour from vegetation and soil, leading to more intense droughts or floods.

Electrification based on renewable energy production is considered to be the most effective way to tackle this issue. As a result, electricity demand is projected to increase significantly on a pathway towards climate neutrality. It is well known that increasing the current level of renewable based production is however not enough: such a production needs to be integrated into the energy system by means of a smarter grid infrastructure deeply based on digital and interoperable solutions. In this report, the focus is on the role played by a subset of enabling technologies in the smart grids sector: Transmission innovation (TI), Grid-scale storage services (GSSS), Electric vehicles smart charging (EVSC), Advanced meter infrastructure (AMI) and Home energy management systems (HEMS).

The study uses data from a systematic literature review, semi-structured interviews and an online survey of key stakeholders, and employs qualitative and quantitative methods to analyse risks and vulnerabilities. It finds that the EU food supply chain faces a broad range of risks and sheds light on the factors that make it vulnerable to these risks. The analysis identifies key characteristics of risks, such as origin, time horizon, likelihood of occurrence, potential impact and exposure. Key risks to food supply and food security are highlighted, as are the main risks threatening different Member States (including the outermost regions) and the different sectors and stages of the EU food supply chain.

The costs of CCUS vary widely depending on the industry, technology, location, plant design and regulatory frameworks in place. The US, EU, and Japan have patented the most high-value inventions, and within the EU, the leading Member States in this context are France, Germany and the Netherlands. Denmark is the new leader in public R&D investment in CCUS for 2021. Global venture capital investment more than doubled from 2021 to 2022, with the US attracting most VC investment. CCUS offers circular carbon economy benefits, but there are concerns about leakages, safety, and public acceptance. CCUS hubs aim to cluster local emitters and pair them with transport and storage developers, for example at Porthos hub in the port of Rotterdam.", "published_on": "2023-10-19", "added_on":

Despite the existence of commercial pathways for advanced biofuel production, there is limited installed capacity and planned production. However, innovative technologies such as biomass gasification and biomethanol production have shown promise in industrial settings. The main challenges include high capital expenditures and the availability of sustainable biomass feedstock. Investment in biofuels research and development (R&I) and venture capital (VC) investments in biofuel firms have shown a decrease in recent years. The EU accounts for a significant portion of both early and late-stage investments, as well as being a leader in high-value patents. The biofuels sector has made a significant contribution to the EU GDP and job creation. However, the EU has a negative biofuel trade balance due to increased imports.

The EU hosts 44 GW of pumped hydropower, that is a quarter of the global installed capacity. A major challenge for the hydropower sector is to pursue energy, climate and environmental targets at the same time. Hydropower is a key player in several EU Directives and programmes, i.e. the WFD, the Flood Directive, the Renewable Energy Directive (REPowerEU) among others. Therefore, sustainable hydropower needs to achieve a good balance between electricity generation, social benefits and impacts on the ecosystem and biodiversity.

According to projections, an even broader deployment of photovoltaic systems is required in order to achieve the goals set in the EGD. Therefore, the promising advancements in photovoltaics are crucial for the next years, both to reach EGD targets and to favour the emergence of competitive new European industrial players and clusters

In particular, at a meso level, we suggest a framework tailored to different types of JRC LLs projects, namely: business model validation projects, projects focused on the co-creation of solutions, technical validation projects and impact assessment projects.

PV is the fastest-growing source of electricity production from renewable energies and a pillar for EU\u2019s energy transition. According to projections, an even broader deployment of photovoltaic systems is required in order to achieve the goals set in the European Green Deal (EGD). The current trend of the EU market shows that it is growing faster than what is required to reach the new PV system capacity installations by 2030 as described in the EU Solar Strategy communication. As the overall global demand for PV components is growing even faster than in the EU and trade frictions can occur, precaution is required to avoid a fallout of international supply chain disruptions on the deployment of PV in the EU. To hedge such a risk, the EU value chain sho...", "published_on": "2023-10-18", "added_on": "2023-10-24", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC135034", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC135034/JRC135034_01.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/c9986b3ee061d28ea60e98aef8405ad0.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/c9986b3ee061d28ea60e98aef8405ad0.png", "topics": ["Nature", "Sustainable energy", "Technology", "Energy", "Building-integrated photovoltaics", "Solar cell", "Monocrystalline silicon", "Levelized cost of electricity", "Polycrystalline silicon", "Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell", "Perovskite solar cell", "Multi-junction solar cell", "Cadmium telluride photovoltaics", "Solar panel", "Renewable energy", "Solar power", "Venture capital", "Thin-film solar cell", "Agrivoltaics", "Photovoltaic system", "Crystalline silicon", "Photovoltaics", "Economy", "Energy conversion", "Electricity generation", "Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems", "Carbon neutrality", "International Energy Agency", "Energy harvesting", "Feed-in tariff", "Heterojunction solar cell", "Renewable energy commercialization", "Energy policy of the European Union", "European Union", "European Green Deal", "Energy return on investment", "Euro", "Sustainable technologies", "Energy development", "Physical sciences", "Physical quantities", "Glass applications", "Innovation", "Solar energy", "Optoelectronics", "Government spending"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "environment>natural resources", "science and technology>technology and engineering", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>energy and resource", "economy, business and finance>economy", "science and technology", "environment", "environment>natural resources>renewable energy", "science and technology>technology and engineering>electronics"], "source_tags": ["Energy and transport"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/732675", "9789268083871", "JRC135034", "EUR 31691 EN", "OP KJ-NA-31-691-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1002/pip.3189", "title": "Impact of weighted average cost of capital, capital expenditure, and other parameters on future utility\u2010scale PV levelised cost of electricity", "journal": "Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.5772/intechopen.88326", "title": "Toxic Materials Used in Thin Film Photovoltaics and Their Impacts on Environment", "publisher": "IntechOpen"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143528", "title": "Environmental impacts of solar photovoltaic systems: A critical review of recent progress and future outlook", "journal": "Science of The Total Environment", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.rser.2022.112109", "title": "Impact of climatic conditions on prospects for integrated photovoltaics in electric vehicles", "journal": "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.099", "title": "Transition pathways optimization methodology through EnergyPLAN software for long-term energy planning", "journal": "Applied Energy", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.wpi.2019.101927", "title": "Assessing private R&D spending in Europe for climate change mitigation technologies via patent data", "journal": "World Patent Information", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.wpi.2019.02.001", "title": "SQL query to increase data accuracy and completeness in PATSTAT", "journal": "World Patent Information", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.2760/814959", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.solmat.2021.111277", "title": "A comparative life cycle assessment of silicon PV modules: Impact of module design, manufacturing location and inventory", "journal": "Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.esr.2021.100677", "title": "International landscape of the inventive activity on climate change mitigation technologies.

With this focus, the study presents strategic areas of intervention covering a new social contract, governance for sustainability, people and economy, and the global perspective on sustainability. The study reflects on the agency of EU actors (such as government at various levels, business, and communities) to address the strategic areas of intervention as part of collectively addressing sustainability transitions. The study builds on a participatory foresight exercise, which generated four foresight scenarios for a climate-neutral EU in 2050. Based on each scenario, a corresponding transition pathway was co-created and analysed through the process. The study presents and analyses these outputs of the process.

for an enhanced traffic management as well as to identify innovative ways and tools to optimise traffic efficiency.In particular the debate on centralised versus decentralised traffic management in the presence of connected and automated vehicles has started attracting the attention of the research community.In this context, the Symposium provides a remarkable opportunity to share novel ideas

The study also showed that sharing vehicle information such as fuel consumption or emissions to a fully BC-based monitoring system would be technically feasible. Simulations also indicated that it is possible to connect a vehicle fleet of 280 million vehicles, the EC and 27 Member States via two heterogeneous BCs communicating in tandem at a pilot level.

Risk management and knowledge management are still developing and maturing both theoretically and practically. The connection between knowledge and risk management is essentially assumed and implicit with not enough explicit combined study and use. This seminar was organized in order to explore relations and complementarity between knowledge, risk and management in a cross-cutting way.The seminar program included 25 presentations, of which five were keynote lectures, and one forum to discuss the main theme. Keynotes and other presentations included the views and experience of different stakeholders from universities, research centres, industry and safety authorities. The topics addressed were related to knowledge and risk management from various perspectives: safety, risk assessment, use of scenarios, resilience, horizon scanning, early warning signals, database management,...", "published_on": "2021-09-09", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC126686", "pdf_url":

This is mainly due to the growth of commercial and public activities and their associated demand for heating, cooling ventilation (HVAC), ICT services and lighting.Commercial and public buildings, and urban areas are a key area where the CO2 reduction could be achieved in a cost-effective manner. As a consequence all actors need to take all necessary steps to disseminate good practice, foster investments in energy efficiency and provide technical solutions for the commercial building sector. This includes behaviour changes on how companies, architects, urban planner and building occupiers invest, design and operate non-residential buildings.The integration of distributed generation, district heating and cooling and renewable energy sources (RES), demand response and smart grids would enable further CO2 and energy saving and pave the way for Net Zero Energy Buildings and Districts.

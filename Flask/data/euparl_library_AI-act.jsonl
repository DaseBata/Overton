The Commission proposes to complement and modernise the EU liability framework to introduce new rules specific to damages caused by AI systems. The new rules intend to ensure that persons harmed by AI systems enjoy the same level of protection as persons harmed by other technologies in the EU.

For example, it can help citizens to gain a better understanding of politics and engage more easily in democratic debate.

More generally, the study stresses that the scope of the current legal approach to biometric data in EU law, centred on the use of such data for identification purposes, leaves out n...", "published_on": "2021-12-16", "added_on": "2022-12-07", "document_url": "https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_STU(2021)697191", "pdf_url": "https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/697191/EPRS_BRIE(2021)697191(ANN)_EN.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/euparl_library/3c6aac13ebff0b2fef2872794eeb8602.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/euparl_library/3c6aac13ebff0b2fef2872794eeb8602.png", "topics": ["Artificial intelligence", "Biometrics", "Identity document", "Law", "Justice", "Government", "Issues in ethics", "General Data Protection Regulation", "Eu-LISA", "Facial recognition system", "Schengen Area", "Personal data", "Data Protection Directive", "Visa policy of the Schengen Area", "S and Marper v United Kingdom", "European Union", "Forensic identification", "European Court of Human Rights", "Risk", "Treaty on European Union", "Politics", "Fingerprint", "European Union law", "Information privacy", "Authentication", "Branches of science", "European Data Protection Supervisor", "Privacy", "Public law", "Categorization", "Technology", "Surveillance", "Rights", "Gender", "Applied ethics", "Schengen Information System", "Research", "Visa Information System", "Area of freedom, security and justice", "Concepts in metaphysics", "Emotion"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["politics", "crime, law and justice", "crime, law and justice>law", "crime, law and justice>law>civil law", "society>values", "science and technology", "politics>government", "crime, law and justice>law>civil law>regulation", "society>values>ethics", "society"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": [], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [], "policy": [{"overton_id": "eucommission-740e9997affbadd675f2f25d5a956202", "title": "Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the", "policy_source_id": "eucommission"}], "news": [], "people": [{"person": "Gloria Gonz\u00e1lez Fuster", "affiliation": "Vrije Universiteit Brussel", "snippet": "This document is based on the STOA study 'Person identification, human rights and ethical principles: Rethinking\nbiometrics in the era of artificial intelligence'.

An increasing number of EU individuals aged 16-74 use the internet at least weekly, (86 % in 2021). A 2021 Special Eurobarometer on Digital Rights and Principles revealed that the use and abuse of personal data ranks among the top three most worrying aspects of the widespread adoption of digital tools and the internet. According to a 2019 Special Eurobarometer survey on the GDPR, 78 % of respondents are either concerned or 'very concerned' about the control of their personal data provided online. Only 22 % of respondents who use the internet said that they always feel informed about the terms and conditions under which the personal data they provide online is collected and used. Conversely, the survey showed that 67 % of respondents know about the GDPR and that the number of those aware of the existence of a public authority responsible for protecting their personal data rights increased by 20 percentage points from 2015 to 2018. Respondents in Estonia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (UK) were most likely to have exercised their data rights, while respondents in Czechia and Slovenia were least likely to have exercised theirs. According to a 2019 expert group survey, requests to exercise data subjects' rights have increased in volume in both the private and the public sector and have become more wide ranging since the entry into force of the GDPR. Moreover, both the expert group survey and the EU Fundamental Rights Agency's (FRA) 2019 Fundamental rights report point to a significant increase in the number of complaints submitted to EU Member States' national data protection authorities (DPAs). Following complaints by individuals and organisations, several DPAs have launched actions against companies under the GDPR, including for lack of transparency, facial recognition, dating apps, transparency obligations, on location data, data breaches, children's data on Instagram, and WhatsApp. https://digital-agenda-data.eu/charts/see-the-evolution-of-an-indicator-and-compare-countries#chart=%7B%22indicator-group%22:%22internet-usage%22,%22indicator%22:%22i_iuse%22,%22breakdown%22:%22ind_total%22,%22unit-measure%22:%22pc_ind%22,%22ref-area%22:%5B%22EU%22%5D%7Dhttps://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desihttps://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/2270https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/2222https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/2075https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/core/api/front/document/31527/downloadhttps://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2019-fundamental-rights-report-2019_en.pdf https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2019/cnils-restricted-committee-imposes-financial-penalty-50-million-euros_en https://www.cnil.fr/en/facial-recognition-cnil-orders-clearview-ai-stop-reusing-photographs-available-internet https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/latest-news/data-protection-commission-launches-statutory-inquiry-mtch-technology https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/data-protection-commission-opens-statutory-inquiry-google-ireland-limited https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/latest-news/data-protection-commission-launches-statutory-inquiry-googles-processing https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48262681 https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/data-protection-commissions-two-statutory-inquiries-facebooks-processing-childrens-data-instagram https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/data-protection-commission-announces-decision-whatsapp-inquiry", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48262681", "matched_news_outlet": "BBC News"}], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "may conflict with EU dataprotection and privacy.

The PLD also complements other legal instruments within the EU liability framework that address, for example, contractual liability and product safety. Significant societal change since 1985, leading to new ways to produce, distribute and operate products and services on the internal market, poses challenges for the current EU liability regime. As the EU is committed to a green and digital transition, which is expected to bring enormous benefits to society and the economy, it is all the more important to update the product liability rules so that the regulatory framework for compensation ensures equal treatment, whether the damage stems from use of emerging technologies or not.

In the autumn of 2022, EU leaders discussed three lines of action: 1) reducing energy demand; 2) increasing security of supply; and 3) reducing energy prices. They also considered the reform of the energy market, a sensitive topic that had been raised for the first time a year earlier at the informal summit in Brdo pri Kranju. In the Granada Declaration, EU leaders highlighted how they effectively responded to energy blackmail by reducing dependencies and diversifying sources. Another method for responding to energy blackmail, was to ensure a higher level of reserves.

The directive does not state the amount at which minimum wages should be set, but provides a framework to promote adequate minimum wages across the EU.

A compromise deal on the long-term budget package including the MFF and Recovery Fund was finally reached by the EU institutions' negotiators in December 2020, after a stand-off with Hungary and Poland, with the (passive) support of Slovenia, blocking the deal in the Council because of their objection to the rule of law conditionality stemming from their current national circumstances. https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/economy-finance/ip156_en.pdfhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Inflation_in_the_euro_area#Euro_area_annual_inflation_rate_and_its_main_componentshttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/43300/200410_peg-centeno-letter-to-pec-michel_covid.pdfhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-dombrovskis/eu-could-finance-1-5-trillion-euro-recovery-fund-with-bonds-dombrovskis-idUSKCN21W0KGhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/04/09/report-on-the-comprehensive-economic-policy-response-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/04/23/conclusions-by-president-charles-michel-following-the-video-conference-with-members-of-the-european-council-on-23-april-2020/https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_940https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45109/210720-euco-final-conclusions-en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2397 https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-should-hold-firm-against-hungary-poland-in-budget-fight-romanian-pm/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-should-hold-firm-against-hungary-poland-in-budget-fight-romanian-pm/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/8da39299-b257-4e8f-9b83-a84a8930f1c1", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8da39299-b257-4e8f-9b83-a84a8930f1c1", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-angela-merkel-eu-bonds/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-angela-merkel-eu-bonds/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/eight-countries-led-by-austria-slam-calls-to-loosen-eu-fiscal-rules/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=dc2c9a0237-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_09_10_05_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-dc2c9a0237-189747361", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eight-countries-led-by-austria-slam-calls-to-loosen-eu-fiscal-rules/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=dc2c9a0237-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_09_10_05_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-dc2c9a0237-189747361", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "The Swedish Council Presidency reached an agreement at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 8-9 June 2023 on two crucial migration files, asylum and migration management regulation (AMMR) and the asylum procedure regulation (APR).

This is an important step in the transformation of European electricity generation, but only a small one compared to the planned goal of 55 % greenhouse gas reductions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050 in Europe.  The EU countries will need huge investments in infrastructure to transport renewable energies from the locations of their generation to the locations of consumption. Furthermore, for the desired transformation of European electricity generation, both pricing and taxation of energies (and greenhouse gas emissions) need to be coordinated such that the EU remains competitive and effective incentives are set.  Global data also show that the overall electricity transition is not progressing in line with climate targets. Clean power generation is not yet being built fast enough to keep pace with the rising electricity demand. Wind and solar power plants make up the bulk, but their growth has slowed in recent years. Even the temporary drop in electricity demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic is not enough to put the world on track and electricity demand will undoubtedly pick up soon, especially as the world seeks to electrify all sectors that still rely on fossil fuels. Solutions and more ambition worldwide are needed urgently.       European Union  The chart below shows the EU's energy sources since 2020.     The graph below shows the ratio of renewable to fossil energy sources in various European countries in 2020.     The EU has set itself the goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050. The graph below shows the targets for 2030 and 2050 compared to the CO2 emissions since 1990.      The graph below shows electricity prices in Euro per kWh in different European countries. The extreme differences are an important aspect for competitiveness.

Whereas most of the biggest platforms have so far avoided explicit alignment with any specific political agenda \u2013 at least seen from the North Atlantic perspective \u2013 this could change. Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter is a case in point, given his history of spreading anti-science narratives, and his strong business ties with authoritarian actors such as Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. Since taking control, he has fired key executives and lowered protections against racist and hate speech and delivered a string of pro-Republican messages. These have increased concern about the risks of a major platform taking a highly partisan approach. In a similar way, an existing social media company could decide to work towards boosting a specific partisan, anti-democratic agenda. New platforms \u2013 launched by non-democratic states or state actors, or even pushed by anti-democratic non-state actors in a democratic country \u2013 could covertly or overtly further an ideological, anti-democratic agenda, exploiting vulnerable audiences. In such a scenario, the social media platforms in question could, for example, customise their algorithms to give preference to anti-democratic or anti-EU views and people. Ultimately, one or more large platforms with an anti-democratic agenda could use its algorithmic power to manipulate the public to vote for anti-democratic actors, foment widespread unrest and/or overthrow elected governments. In this scenario, EU legislation and action would fail to address the risks posed by algorithms to political debate and could ultimately fall victim to weaponisation of the infosphere. https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/4/29/as-musk-eyes-twitter-china-and-india-dissidents-fear-censorshiphttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/business/media/elon-musk-politics-twitter.htmlhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2022/738199/EPRS_BRI(2022)738199_EN.pdf", "matched_news_url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/4/29/as-musk-eyes-twitter-china-and-india-dissidents-fear-censorshiphttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/business/media/elon-musk-politics-twitter.htmlhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2022/738199/EPRS_BRI(2022)738199_EN.pdf", "matched_news_outlet": "Al Jazeera"}, {"reference_string": "Resilience against natural disasters and assuring connectivity without disruptions: Global internet connectivity is at risk from climate disasters such as flooding, storms and hurricanes, as these types of extreme weather events are becoming more likely due to climate change.

Hossain and Hallock (2022) highlight that political grievances against governments considered unable to provide citizens with the basic necessities of life also play an important role in economically difficult contexts. Social factors also play a part, particularly a tradition and culture of protest at national level. An IMF working paper by Redl & Hlatshwayo (2021) that uses a machine learning technique to analyse drivers of social unrest shows that the most frequent predictor of unrest is the previous occurrence of unrest in the same country or in neighbouring countries, well ahead of inflation and food prices (around 10 times more predictive than these). Based on this model, EU countries that have experienced frequent protests in the recent past are most likely to experience it again. Developments since 2022 have confirmed this trend, but have also seen a resurgence of protests in northern European countries, which have been less exposed to protests in the recent past. New EU Member States which experienced particular economic difficulties, including some of the highest inflation rates in Europe (such as the Baltic States) did not, at least initially, witness significant protests over inflation, despite its brutal impact on the purchasing power of the population. Commentators explained this apparently paradoxical state through experience of inflation in the recent past, and a feeling of national unity in the face of hardship caused by a deeply unjust war on their doorsteps. Gradually, however, social protests by disaffected professional groups also extended their grip (e.g. in Hungary and Romania). https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021263-print-pdf.ashx https://www.politico.eu/article/energy-crisis-food-and-fuel-protests-surged-in-2022-the-biggest-were-in-europe/ https://www.ft.com/content/cf88d42a-6b59-4520-9c70-638b267c8de0 https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2022/12/09/strikes-sackings-and-soaring-prices-teacher-anger-rages-in-hungary https://www.romania-insider.com/romanian-government-beset-strikes-public-sectors-2023", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/cf88d42a-6b59-4520-9c70-638b267c8de0", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "In May 2023, slightly more than 30 % of the approved grants and loans had been paid out and, on average, the RRF seemed to be operating according to the agreed timeline. However, progress has varied between Member States. In some, increasing prices and the changing political landscape and priorities have not been conducive to the smooth implementation of the agreed investments and reforms. Whereas payments have been highest in Spain (53.3 % of the approved resources), Lithuania (37.4 %), Greece (36.4 %), Croatia (35.2 %) and Italy (34.9 %), countries such as Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Sweden and the Netherlands have not received a single euro. In particular, unblocking the resources in Hungary and Poland depends on politically tough reforms related to the rule of law. In some countries, the difficulties in fulfilling certain milestones and targets have resulted in the decision to postpone requests for payments or to amend the NRRP. This is the case, for instance, for the plans of Belgium, Germany, Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Moreover, there are signals that Italy, the biggest beneficiary of the RRF, after a good start, is beginning to struggle to meet the conditions for the next payments.

Despite Western export controls, it had caught up with Taiwan in advanced semiconductor manufacturing, even outcompeting it thanks to the vast economies of scale and gravitational pull of its huge market. Taiwan had lost its protective shield as a unique global hub for state-of-the-art chip manufacturing. After the gradual loss to China of a major share of its chips trade, Taiwan had faced mounting difficulties in sustaining the growing military budget necessary to acquire asymmetric defence capabilities, exacerbating a rising weapons backlog. In parallel, China had enacted legislation requiring foreign commercial shipments to and from Taiwan to be reloaded in Chinese ports and to be carried to and from Taiwan by Chinese cargo shuttles. To enforce its legislation applicable to Taiwan's trade, China had leveraged access to its critical raw materials and inputs required for the digital and green transition and offered inducements to foreign carriers to use alternative shipping routes through the Arctic. China had thereby gradually gained control of Taiwan's trade and essential food and energy supplies. https://thediplomat.com/2022/12/why-europe-struggles-with-us-export-controls-on-china/#:%7E:text=In%20October%202022%2C%20the%20United,semiconductor%20manufacturing%20equipment%20(SME).https://www.ft.com/content/baa27f42-0557-4377-839b-a4f4524cfa20https://www.bruegel.org/podcast/lessons-chinas-semiconductor-technology-pushhttps://www.dw.com/en/taiwans-military-tests-new-capabilities-to-deter-china-threat/a-61129158https://warontherocks.com/2023/01/the-real-reasons-for-taiwans-arms-backlog-and-how-to-help-fill-it/https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2018/620231/EPRS_BRI(2018)620231_EN.pdf https://thediplomat.com/2022/09/taiwans-greatest-vulnerability-is-its-energy-supply/", "matched_news_url": "https://thediplomat.com/2022/09/taiwans-greatest-vulnerability-is-its-energy-supply/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Diplomat"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/11/philippines-china-stand-off-south-china-sea", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/11/philippines-china-stand-off-south-china-sea", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-summit-idUSBRE8AJ08520121120", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-summit-idUSBRE8AJ08520121120", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/25/asia/internet-undersea-cables-intl-hnk/index.html", "matched_news_url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/25/asia/internet-undersea-cables-intl-hnk/index.html", "matched_news_outlet": "CNN"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://thediplomat.com/2023/01/taiwan-politics-outlook-a-kmt-resurgence/", "matched_news_url": "https://thediplomat.com/2023/01/taiwan-politics-outlook-a-kmt-resurgence/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Diplomat"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/correct-understanding-of-china-another-chinese-diplomat-advocates-reeducation-of-taiwan/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/correct-understanding-of-china-another-chinese-diplomat-advocates-reeducation-of-taiwan/", "matched_news_outlet": "National Review"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/xi-putin-summit-russia-inches-closer-china-new-cold-war-looms", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/xi-putin-summit-russia-inches-closer-china-new-cold-war-looms", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-raises-accusation-un-ukraine-dirty-bomb-plans-2022-10-25/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-raises-accusation-un-ukraine-dirty-bomb-plans-2022-10-25/", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.wired.com/2012/09/what-do-the-h-bomb-and-the-internet-have-in-common-paul-baran/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.wired.com/2012/09/what-do-the-h-bomb-and-the-internet-have-in-common-paul-baran/", "matched_news_outlet": "Wired Magazine"}, {"reference_string": "A major shift occurred regarding energy, with a security perspective replacing the trade perspective that had prevailed for the past two decades.

Meeting in Versailles in March 2022, EU leaders agreed that the Union should progressively phase out its dependency on Russian fossil fuels, and on fossil fuels in general, accelerate the deployment of renewables, diversify suppliers and sources, enhance connectivity, refill gas storage facilities, and counter the spike in energy prices. Consequently, in May 2022, the European Commission proposed REPowerEU, an initiative allowing the EU to phase out its dependency on Russian fossil fuels and bolstering green initiatives. In response, Russia has re-routed its energy exports to India and China. When it comes to nuclear energy, dependency on Russian raw material imports is unchanged (around 20 %) and has still to be tackled. So far, EU Member States' behaviour on this has spanned from stalling (Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden), to reducing (Bulgaria) and even increasing (Finland, Hungary and Slovakia) imports of nuclear-related materials. https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2022/699496/EPRS_BRI(2022)699496_EN.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_3131 https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/russia-says-it-has-rerouted-all-oil-exports-india-the-biggest-buyer/ https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-just-cant-quit-russia-for-nuclear-power/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-just-cant-quit-russia-for-nuclear-power/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Physical protection of submarine cables: Various authors have presented ideas on how to protect submarine internet cables in Europe. The creation of cable protection zones (e.g. banning certain types of anchoring and fishing) in critical areas within national waters would help to avoid unintentional severing of cables by following the examples set in Australia and New Zealand. In this respect, a European Parliament analysis suggested that Parliament could invite maritime authorities to suggest solutions. A 2022 policy brief by the Atlantic Centre considered investing in submarine cables' sensors/detection systems on critical points to be a useful tool to detect potential physical threats; Member States should envisage the use of such detection systems as part of licence requirements for landing submarine cables and the EU could sponsor research in this field and make recommendations on the allocation of licences. Finally, following the example of the Australian government, which appears to have concluded that ownership of certain submarine cables is of strategic concern, a European Commission study recommends that the EU create a comprehensive and common approach to support EU-based companies in the development and construction of new secure submarine cable routes. A European review of submarine cable ownership and risk assessment for future submarine cable projects might help in making potential strategic decisions. https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Undersea-Cables.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EXPO_IDA(2022)702557https://www.defesa.gov.pt/pt/pdefesa/ac/pub/acpubs/Documents/Atlantic-Centre_PB_13.pdfhttps://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/3/737/pdf?version=1581329530https://cerre.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GGDE_FulIReport.pdfhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-solomonislands-internet/australia-keeps-china-out-of-internet-cabling-for-pacific-neighbor-idUSKBN1J90JYhttps://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/a0b01654-9394-11ec-b4e4-01aa75ed71a1https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/eu-eyes-arctic-internet-cable-to-connect-europe-to-asia-via-alaska/https://oceans-and-fisheries.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-03/join-2023-8_en.pdf https://www.ft.com/content/d07dbd19-5e8b-4543-85f6-bbf1a6a0858d", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d07dbd19-5e8b-4543-85f6-bbf1a6a0858d", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44640959", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44640959", "matched_news_outlet": "BBC News"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-apec-china-taiwan-idUSBRE99503Q20131006", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-apec-china-taiwan-idUSBRE99503Q20131006", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Finally, another risk could arise from historical experience, according to which political leaders facing serious domestic problems tend to seek to distract from them by forging ahead with foreign policy action. China has many such domestic problems, e.g. the end of China's demographic dividend, slowing economic growth, a state-led economy leaving limited space for China's vibrant private sector, rising debt at all levels, a volatile real estate sector, and a weak health and old-age care system. In the past few decades, China's economic growth has been the Party's main source of legitimacy for its rule over the people. As slower growth is the 'new normal', its leadership may start to redirect domestic discontent away from the Party towards external enemies.

With the potential to drastically change the economy and society, digital transformation can bring both promising developments and challenges. There is wide variation in advances in digital transformation both within the European Union and between Member States. To this end, the European Union and its Member States are developing and adopting policies targeted at boosting digital transformation. This Cost of Non-Europe study analyses the status quo in digital transformation in the European Union and identifies gaps and barriers hampering the full potential of the digital transformation. Based on this examination, the cost of non-Europe is analysed qualitatively and quantitatively using a computable general equilibrium model.

Recent developments, including court rulings at both EU and Member State levels alluding to the rule of law, indicate that deep divisions persist in the EU regarding the understanding of democracy and European values; observers argue that the EU's rule of law crisis is still far from being resolved. EU leaders' various discussions have not led to a solution on the issue, but rather postponed direct action at European level for the moment. Consequently, EU leaders might need to return to this topic again in the near future. At their meeting of 24-25 March 2022, the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, urged EU leaders to use the current 'window of opportunity' to find a way forward on the rule of law. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-22-2020-INIT/en/pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694201/EPRS_BRI(2021)694201_EN.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694243/EPRS_BRI(2021)694243_EN.pdfhttps://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-10/cp210192en.pdf https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=244185&pageIndex=0&doclang=FR&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=1699703 https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-legal-eu-court-reprimand-disciplinary-procedure-for-judges/ https://www.politico.eu/article/five-ways-the-eus-democracy-crisis-could-end/ https://eu.boell.org/en/2020/12/18/after-crisis-crisis-rule-law-headache-wont-go-away https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220324IPR26159/this-is-our-moment-president-metsola-to-eu-leaders", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/five-ways-the-eus-democracy-crisis-could-end/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Industrial policy has returned to the forefront of political agendas in the wake of the coronavirus crisis and the war in Ukraine.

However, they also noted the importance of preserving the level playing field and the 'integrity of the single market' whilst maintaining Europe's global competitiveness. The growing use of subsidies worldwide, more particularly the adoption of the US IRA, has caused concern for some in the EU, as it is considered as a discriminatory instrument, violating WTO rules and with potentially damaging effect on the EU's green tech industry. Despite differing views on how or whether to change State aid policy, the European Council agreed that it was imperative for the EU to be competitive and productive, particularly in sectors connected to the digital and green transitions. In February and March 2023, the European Council agreed that State aid policy needed adjusting in order to become simpler, faster and more predictable, allowing for temporary and proportionate support. Finding the correct balance between enabling State aid to support EU industry and preserving the level playing field in the single market will be a critical issue for the EU and its Member States to resolve over the coming months. To monitor these developments, the European Council has asked the Commission to report regularly on the impact of State aid policy on the single market as well as on the EU's competitiveness globally. https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2022)743681 https://www.oecd.org/subsidies/ https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/ https://borderlex.net/2023/02/21/think-tank-responding-to-the-united-states-green-tech-subsidies/ https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2023)739300 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/why-eu-objects-to-us-green-subsidies-tax-breaks-quicktake?cmpid=BBD012723_BRUS&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=230127&utm_campaign=brussels&leadSource=uverify%20wall https://epthinktank.eu/2023/02/07/outlook-for-the-special-european-council-meeting-of-9-10-february-2023/#:%7E:text=and%20Annastiina%20Papunen.-,EU%20Heads%20of%20State%20or%20Government%20will%20gather%20on%209,migration%20and%20the%20EU%27s%20economy. https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/european-council/2023/02/09/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/why-eu-objects-to-us-green-subsidies-tax-breaks-quicktake?cmpid=BBD012723_BRUS&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=230127&utm_campaign=brussels&leadSource=uverify%20wall", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/24/elon-musks-crew-dragon-puts-america-back-in-the-space-race", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/24/elon-musks-crew-dragon-puts-america-back-in-the-space-race", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Taxation has been a very visible topic in the EU in recent years.

Progress at EU level was stalled in an effort to find a global solution with the OECD. At the July 2020 European Council meeting, EU leaders tasked the Commission with putting forward a proposal on a digital levy in the first semester of 2021, considering ongoing OECD negotiations. As agreed in the interinstitutional agreement of 16 December 2020, such a levy was due to be one of the EU budget's new 'own resources' that would contribute to paying off EU debts incurred to finance the recovery package as well as play an important role in the fair taxation of digital companies. In December 2021, the Commission proposed a directive on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups in the Union, which closely follows the international agreement with adjustments to ensure compliance with EU law. In April 2022 at the Economic and Financial Affairs Council meeting, Poland vetoed the latest compromise proposal by the French Presidency, thereby blocking the file.

The European Council stated in March 2019 that it looks forward 'to the Commission's recommendation on a concerted approach to the security of 5G networks'. The recommendation was published a few days after the European Council meeting. Since then, the security of 5G networks, and especially the involvement of the Chinese technology giant Huawei in building the networks, has been a widely discussed topic, notably following the move by the US to block Huawei from its market and to encourage its allies to adopt a similar approach. On 29 January 2020, the Commission published the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity, in which it outlined a set of key actions to ensure the security of the networks, such as limiting dependency on a single supplier and assessing the risk profile of supplies. The multivendor approach has been interpreted by Huawei as meaning that it will be able to take part in building the European 5G networks. The Commission has called on the Member States to 'take concrete and measurable steps' to implement key toolbox measures. EU leaders discussed 5G at their meeting on 1-2 October 2020 and stressed that 'potential 5G suppliers need to be assessed on the basis of common objective criteria' and asked the Member States to send their national plans on the roll-out of 5G to the Commission to 'ensure the rapid deployment of 5G across the EU'. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-1-2019-INIT/en/pdf https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154 https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123 https://agenceurope.eu/en/bulletin/article/12414/7 https://huawei.eu/press-release/huawei-media-statement-following-publication-european-commissions-5g-security-toolbox https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_127 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45910/021020-euco-final-conclusions.pdf?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=European+Council+conclusions%2c+1-2+October+2020", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "In October 2020, EU leaders held a strategic debate to discuss preparations ahead of the next meeting with the African Union (AU) on 9 December 2020.

This results in the difficulty of localising value creation, and as a result, the ensuing taxation questions become increasingly complicated. The issue has caused some transatlantic tensions, as the United States (US) has a very strong 'big tech' digital presence around the world. The US has raised the possibility to impose unilateral tariffs if EU countries were to go ahead with a digital levy. In its March 2021 meeting, the European Council has expressed its preference for and commitment to a global solution within the OECD framework. However, it did not rule out a unilateral EU move if a global solution was not achieved. The European Parliament adopted its position on the matter in April 2021, emphasising that the global solution was the preferred one, but not the only way forward. Multilateral talks finally resulted in an agreement at OECD level in July 2021, the details of which were finalised on 8 October 2021. In the end, all EU Member States accepted to endorse the deal and to be included in the digital taxation framework, which was endorsed by the G20 leaders' meeting in Rome on 31 October. The agreement envisages a global minimum tax rate of at least 15 % and is designed to clarify tax revenue sharing among countries for multinational companies making profits in countries without a physical presence, especially by big digital companies. In July 2021, the European Commission announced that it would suspend work on its own digital levy until the autumn to prioritise the global agreement, although under the interinstitutional agreement of 16 December 2020 this initiative was supposed to be put forward by June 2021. The OECD/G20 agreement has been welcomed by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and Commissioner Gentiloni has hailed its formal endorsement by the G20. https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-to-postpone-digital-tax-proposal/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/48976/250321-vtc-euco-statement-en.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0147_EN.htmlhttps://www.oecd.org/newsroom/130-countries-and-jurisdictions-join-bold-new-framework-for-international-tax-reform.htmhttps://www.oecd.org/tax/oecd-leading-multilateral-efforts-to-address-tax-challenges-from-digitalisation-of-the-economy.htmhttps://www.ft.com/content/3e3e6a7d-67d5-437d-a7b2-29c52ce9c78fhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/52732/final-final-g20-rome-declaration.pdf https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.LI.2020.433.01.0028.01.ENG https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_21_5166 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_5247", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-to-postpone-digital-tax-proposal/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/48976/250321-vtc-euco-statement-en.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0147_EN.htmlhttps://www.oecd.org/newsroom/130-countries-and-jurisdictions-join-bold-new-framework-for-international-tax-reform.htmhttps://www.oecd.org/tax/oecd-leading-multilateral-efforts-to-address-tax-challenges-from-digitalisation-of-the-economy.htmhttps://www.ft.com/content/3e3e6a7d-67d5-437d-a7b2-29c52ce9c78fhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/52732/final-final-g20-rome-declaration.pdf", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Government.

The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) was developed as part of the introduction of the euro and was reinforced in the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis. The framework aims to keep countries' deficit below 3 % of economic output and their public debt below 60 %. Current rules allow Member States some leeway to bend the rules and get away without any fines, which could, if applied (not applied until now) amount to 0.2 % of the country's GDP. Eurozone debt decreased slightly to 95.6 % of economic output (88.1 % of GDP in EU as a whole) in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 100 % at the end of the first quarter, with the highest levels reached in Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium and Cyprus. The Commission has relaunched the debate on the review of EU economic governance, which had begun before the pandemic; the crisis led the EU to suspend the rules in March 2020 by activating the so-called general escape clause. This move enabled governments to take a supportive fiscal stance and to support their economies in the face of the economic and social impact of the pandemic. The rules are set to be applied again only in 2023 on the basis of the Commission's spring 2021 economic forecast. https://pro.politico.eu/news/138913 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/14497745/2-22042022-BP-EN.pdf/90896015-2ac1-081a-2eef-ad8d5f2c0da1 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_5374 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/economic-governance-review_en https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2722", "matched_news_url": "https://pro.politico.eu/news/138913", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46764500", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46764500", "matched_news_outlet": "BBC News"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/eu-confidential/politico-eu-confidential-timothy-garton-ash-second-wave-war-on-leaks/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/eu-confidential/politico-eu-confidential-timothy-garton-ash-second-wave-war-on-leaks/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/24/elon-musks-crew-dragon-puts-america-back-in-the-space-race", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/24/elon-musks-crew-dragon-puts-america-back-in-the-space-race", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-elon-musk-free-mars-colony-constitution-space-law-legality-2020-10?r=US&IR=T", "matched_news_url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-elon-musk-free-mars-colony-constitution-space-law-legality-2020-10?r=US&IR=T", "matched_news_outlet": "Business Insider"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-vaccination-europe-live-data-tracker-coverage/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-vaccination-europe-live-data-tracker-coverage/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "During the coronavirus crisis, the 'solidarity clause' in Article 122 TFEU has been used as legal basis for some of the actions taken to tackle the crisis and support the EU economy in the recovery process.

The shock to EU economies has been symmetrical, and recovery has been stopped short. The discussions on financial solidarity and on how to fund the crisis and recovery package have not been fluid. Differing approaches, on notably the Recovery Fund, led the EU ministers to ask the European Council for guidance. However, considering these differences in views, EU leaders decided to move the issue to the Commission's table and tasked it with analysing the exact needs and producing a proposal as rapidly as possible. The Commission published its proposal on 27 May 2020, and the European Council agreed on the package at its meeting of 17-21 July 2020. A compromise deal on the long-term budget package including the MFF and Recovery Fund was finally reached by the EU institutions' negotiators in December 2020, after a stand-off with Hungary and Poland, with the (passive) support of Slovenia, blocking the deal in the Council because of their objection to the rule of law conditionality stemming from their current national circumstances. https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/economy-finance/ip156_en.pdfhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Inflation_in_the_euro_area#Euro_area_annual_inflation_rate_and_its_main_componentshttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/43300/200410_peg-centeno-letter-to-pec-michel_covid.pdfhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-dombrovskis/eu-could-finance-1-5-trillion-euro-recovery-fund-with-bonds-dombrovskis-idUSKCN21W0KGhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/04/09/report-on-the-comprehensive-economic-policy-response-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/04/23/conclusions-by-president-charles-michel-following-the-video-conference-with-members-of-the-european-council-on-23-april-2020/https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_940https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45109/210720-euco-final-conclusions-en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2397 https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-should-hold-firm-against-hungary-poland-in-budget-fight-romanian-pm/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-should-hold-firm-against-hungary-poland-in-budget-fight-romanian-pm/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "With the debates at the European Council meetings of 10-11 December 2020, 24-25 June 2021 and 21-22 October 2021, the issue of EU values has finally arrived at the level of EU Heads of State or Government.

In 2018, the European Commission put forward two proposals for fair and effective taxation of the digital economy: a short-term solution, to be delivered by an interim digital services tax on revenues from certain digital services, and a permanent reform of corporate tax rules, based on the concept of 'significant digital presence'. Progress at EU level was stalled in an effort to find a global solution with the OECD. At the July 2020 European Council meeting, EU leaders tasked the Commission with putting forward a proposal on a digital levy in the first semester of 2021, considering ongoing OECD negotiations. As agreed in the interinstitutional agreement of 16 December 2020, such a levy was due to be one of the EU budget's new 'own resources' that would contribute to paying off EU debts incurred to finance the recovery package as well as play an important role in the fair taxation of digital companies. In December 2021, the Commission proposed a directive on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups in the Union, which closely follows the international agreement with adjustments to ensure compliance with EU law. In April 2022 at the Economic and Financial Affairs Council meeting, Poland vetoed the latest compromise proposal by the French Presidency, thereby blocking the file.

The European Council stated in March 2019 that it looks forward 'to the Commission's recommendation on a concerted approach to the security of 5G networks'. The recommendation was published a few days after the European Council meeting. Since then, the security of 5G networks, and especially the involvement of the Chinese technology giant Huawei in building the networks, has been a widely discussed topic, notably following the move by the US to block Huawei from its market and to encourage its allies to adopt a similar approach. On 29 January 2020, the Commission published the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity, in which it outlined a set of key actions to ensure the security of the networks, such as limiting dependency on a single supplier and assessing the risk profile of supplies. The multivendor approach has been interpreted by Huawei as meaning that it will be able to take part in building the European 5G networks.

In the digital age, earning profit in a country no longer necessarily requires settingup factories or offices on the ground, but can be effected by offering products or services through digital platforms. This results in the difficulty of localising value creation, and as a result, the ensuing taxation questions become increasingly complicated. The issue has caused some transatlantic tensions, as the United States (US) has a very strong 'big tech' digital presence around the world. The US has raised the possibility to impose unilateral tariffs if EU countries were to go ahead with a digital levy. In its March 2021 meeting, the European Council has expressed its preference for and commitment to a global solution within the OECD framework. However, it did not rule out a unilateral EU move if a global solution was not achieved. The European Parliament adopted its position on the matter in April 2021, emphasising that the global solution was the preferred one, but not the only way forward. Multilateral talks finally resulted in an agreement at OECD level in July 2021, the details of which were finalised on 8 October 2021. In the end, all EU Member States accepted to endorse the deal and to be included in the digital taxation framework, which was endorsed by the G20 leaders' meeting in Rome on 31 October. The agreement envisages a global minimum tax rate of at least 15 % and is designed to clarify tax revenue sharing among countries for multinational companies making profits in countries without a physical presence, especially by big digital companies. In July 2021, the European Commission announced that it would suspend work on its own digital levy until the autumn to prioritise the global agreement, although under the interinstitutional agreement of 16 December 2020 this initiative was supposed to be put forward by June 2021. The OECD/G20 agreement has been welcomed by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and Commissioner Gentiloni has hailed its formal endorsement by the G20. Its implementation is envisaged in the 2022 Commission work programme. https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-to-postpone-digital-tax-proposal/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/48976/250321-vtc-euco-statement-en.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0147_EN.htmlhttps://www.oecd.org/newsroom/130-countries-and-jurisdictions-join-bold-new-framework-for-international-tax-reform.htmhttps://www.oecd.org/tax/oecd-leading-multilateral-efforts-to-address-tax-challenges-from-digitalisation-of-the-economy.htmhttps://www.ft.com/content/3e3e6a7d-67d5-437d-a7b2-29c52ce9c78fhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/52732/final-final-g20-rome-declaration.pdfhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.LI.2020.433.01.0028.01.ENGhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_21_5166https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_5247https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar%3A9fb5131e-30e9-11ec-bd8e-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_2&format=PDF", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-to-postpone-digital-tax-proposal/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/48976/250321-vtc-euco-statement-en.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0147_EN.htmlhttps://www.oecd.org/newsroom/130-countries-and-jurisdictions-join-bold-new-framework-for-international-tax-reform.htmhttps://www.oecd.org/tax/oecd-leading-multilateral-efforts-to-address-tax-challenges-from-digitalisation-of-the-economy.htmhttps://www.ft.com/content/3e3e6a7d-67d5-437d-a7b2-29c52ce9c78fhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/52732/final-final-g20-rome-declaration.pdfhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.LI.2020.433.01.0028.01.ENGhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_21_5166https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_5247https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar%3A9fb5131e-30e9-11ec-bd8e-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_2&format=PDF", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "The issue of rule of law developments in Poland was added to the agenda of the 21-22 October European Council at the last moment.

Countries, including Turkey and Morocco, have threatened to or actually did allow migrants in large numbers to cross EU borders illegally, thereby 'weaponising migration'. Most recently, in the summer of 2021, Belarus started to fly in refugees and to direct them to Lithuania in reaction to EU sanctions, opening another migration route to the EU. At its meeting of 24-45 June 2021, the European Council condemned and rejected any attempt by third countries to 'instrumentalise migrants for political purposes'. European Council President, Charles Michel reiterated this message on 5 July and pledged solidarity with Lithuania. The situation remained charged in August, with over 4 000 migrants having crossed from Belarus into Lithuania this year (compared with 74 in 2020 and just 37 in 2019) and others arriving at the Latvian and Polish borders. Consequently, the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU organised an extraordinary videoconference meeting of interior ministers within the framework of the Council's crisis response mechanism (IPCR), a tool used by EU countries to coordinate during acute crises. Ministers expressed their solidarity with Latvia, Lithuania and Poland and voiced support for providing additional assistance at these external EU borders. In this context, on 7 October 2021, interior ministers from 12 Member States sent a letter to Margaritis Schinas, Vice-President of the European Commission, and Ylva Johansson, Commissioner for Home Affairs, asking 'to adapt the existing legal framework to the new realities'. They noted, in particular, that 'a physical barrier appears to be an effective border protection measure', and proposed that measures in this regard should be 'additionally and adequately funded from the EU budget as a matter of priority'. Following the 21-22 October European Council, President von der Leyen outlined the EU's current and future support for Member States' border management, but also stated that 'there will be no [EU] funding of barbed wire and walls'. https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-says-it-will-no-longer-stop-refugees-from-entering-europe/https://ecfr.eu/article/this-time-is-different-spain-morocco-and-weaponised-migration/https://euobserver.com/world/152305https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694201/EPRS_BRI(2021)694201_EN.pdfhttps://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/1412102714427953159https://euobserver.com/migration/152583https://euobserver.com/tickers/152632https://euobserver.com/tickers/152619https://twitter.com/EU2021SI/status/1425462408731049995https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/en/news/home-affairs-ministers-express-solidarity-with-the-eu-member-states-at-the-border-with-belarus/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/ipcr/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=0ca76056ca-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_08_12_05_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-0ca76056ca-189688461https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/media/y5uoszrv/ipcr-presidency-statement-final_18-8-2021.pdfhttps://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/07/Joint-letter_Adaptation-of-EU-legal-framework-20211007.pdf https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/media-galleries/european-council/meetings/2021-10-21-22-euco/?slide=0", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-says-it-will-no-longer-stop-refugees-from-entering-europe/https://ecfr.eu/article/this-time-is-different-spain-morocco-and-weaponised-migration/https://euobserver.com/world/152305https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694201/EPRS_BRI(2021)694201_EN.pdfhttps://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/1412102714427953159https://euobserver.com/migration/152583https://euobserver.com/tickers/152632https://euobserver.com/tickers/152619https://twitter.com/EU2021SI/status/1425462408731049995https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/en/news/home-affairs-ministers-express-solidarity-with-the-eu-member-states-at-the-border-with-belarus/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/ipcr/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=0ca76056ca-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_08_12_05_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-0ca76056ca-189688461https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/media/y5uoszrv/ipcr-presidency-statement-final_18-8-2021.pdfhttps://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/07/Joint-letter_Adaptation-of-EU-legal-framework-20211007.pdf", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-shooting/french-foreign-leaders-walk-arm-in-arm-as-millions-protest-paris-attacks-idUSKBN0KK05S20150111?utm_source=Facebook", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-shooting/french-foreign-leaders-walk-arm-in-arm-as-millions-protest-paris-attacks-idUSKBN0KK05S20150111?utm_source=Facebook", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/eu-confidential/politico-eu-confidential-timothy-garton-ash-second-wave-war-on-leaks/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/eu-confidential/politico-eu-confidential-timothy-garton-ash-second-wave-war-on-leaks/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "The current global taxation system is one hundred years old and thus is not fit for purpose in an increasingly digitalised and globalised economy. The OECD has been pursuing work under two pillars: (i) the re-allocation of some taxing rights over Multi National Enterprises to the markets where they have business activities and earn profits (ii) set a global minimum corporate tax rate that countries can use to protect their tax bases. Under pillar one, potential solutions are being examined by the Council to determine where tax should be paid and what portion of profits should be taxed. A broad outline of a unified approach on pillar one has been agreed as the basis for further negotiations at the end of January 2020, followed by the endorsement by the G20 finance ministers on 23 February 2020. However, the Commission will examine whether a directive is needed to ensure the consistent and effective implementation of pillar one at EU level. In July, the G20 Finance Ministers mandated the OECD to develop a blueprint on the design of the two pillars ahead of their next meeting on 15-16 October 2020; they were published on 12 October 2020. Under pillar two, a system will be designed to ensure that multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax. On 25 March 2021, the European Council stated the urgent need to address tax challenges resulting from digitalisation and highlighted their preference for a global solution by mid-2021 within the framework of the OECD. In June 2021, the G7 agreed on a global minimum corporate income tax rate of 15 %. The new rules would adjust taxing rights to countries where large multinational enterprises earn their profits. In October 2021, 136 countries agreed to support the tax reform, while four 13 countries have not yet backed the new two-pillar tax package. Three EU Member States (Ireland, Estonia and Hungary) recently joined the agreement; thus all Member States are now officially supporting the tax reform. In the EU, the agreement will need an EU law to be passed and that will require the unanimous agreement of all 27 Member States. https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/130-countries-and-jurisdictions-join-bold-new-framework-for-international-tax-reform.htmhttps://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/oecd-presents-analysis-showing-significant-impact-of-proposed-international-tax-reforms.htmhttps://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-13405-2019-INIT/en/pdfhttps://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/statement-by-the-oecd-g20-inclusive-framework-on-beps-january-2020.pdfhttps://agenceurope.eu/en/bulletin/article/12432/12https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_5247https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/oecd-g20-inclusive-framework-on-beps-invites-public-input-on-the-reports-on-pillar-one-and-pillar-two-blueprints.htmhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/48976/250321-vtc-euco-statement-en.pdf https://www.politico.eu/article/oecd-global-tax-deal-reached-g20/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/oecd-global-tax-deal-reached-g20/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Given the serious human, economic and social consequences of the health crisis, criticism has been directed towards the lack of overall preparedness in combatting the pandemic across the EU, and the lack of coordination among Member States at the start of the outbreak.

Consequently, EU leaders might need to return to this topic again in the near future. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-22-2020-INIT/en/pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694201/EPRS_BRI(2021)694201_EN.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694243/EPRS_BRI(2021)694243_EN.pdfhttps://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-10/cp210192en.pdf https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=244185&pageIndex=0&doclang=FR&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=1699703 https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-legal-eu-court-reprimand-disciplinary-procedure-for-judges/ https://www.politico.eu/article/five-ways-the-eus-democracy-crisis-could-end/ https://eu.boell.org/en/2020/12/18/after-crisis-crisis-rule-law-headache-wont-go-away", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/five-ways-the-eus-democracy-crisis-could-end/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-in-crisis-over-hungary-poland-budget-hold-up/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=b4594a9d08-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_11_17_05_59&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-b4594a9d08-189688461", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-in-crisis-over-hungary-poland-budget-hold-up/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=b4594a9d08-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_11_17_05_59&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-b4594a9d08-189688461", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16/RRF-Presidential-letter-to-Ursula-van-der-Leyen.pdf?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=63f8cbec35-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_11_18_04_52&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-63f8cbec35-189688461", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16/RRF-Presidential-letter-to-Ursula-van-der-Leyen.pdf?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=63f8cbec35-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_11_18_04_52&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-63f8cbec35-189688461", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-5g-arson-attacks-online-theories/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-5g-arson-attacks-online-theories/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-elon-musk-free-mars-colony-constitution-space-law-legality-2020-10?r=US&IR=T", "matched_news_url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-elon-musk-free-mars-colony-constitution-space-law-legality-2020-10?r=US&IR=T", "matched_news_outlet": "Business Insider"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/24/elon-musks-crew-dragon-puts-america-back-in-the-space-race", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/24/elon-musks-crew-dragon-puts-america-back-in-the-space-race", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/8da39299-b257-4e8f-9b83-a84a8930f1c1", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8da39299-b257-4e8f-9b83-a84a8930f1c1", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52450854", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52450854", "matched_news_outlet": "BBC News"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://pro.politico.eu/news/138913", "matched_news_url": "https://pro.politico.eu/news/138913", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://pro.politico.eu/news/137459", "matched_news_url": "https://pro.politico.eu/news/137459", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/post-brexit-talks-sefcovic-northern-ireland/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/post-brexit-talks-sefcovic-northern-ireland/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Letter-to-Vestager.pdf?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=194a035c23-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_02_06_06_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-194a035c23-189690569", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Letter-to-Vestager.pdf?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=194a035c23-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_02_06_06_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-194a035c23-189690569", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "During the coronavirus crisis, the 'solidarity clause' in Article 122 TFEU has been used as legal basis for some of the actions taken to tackle the crisis and support the EU economy in the recovery process.

This new form of meetings has enabled EU leaders in a context of lockdown to take joint action to tackle the crisis. Considering the particular nature of the European Council however, and notably the importance of small bilateral meetings on the side-lines in achieving agreements, video meetings are unlikely to replace physical meetings fully when crucial decisions are on the agenda. In such a format, EU leaders tend to be more cautious and keep to their written statements since the confidentiality of discussions is not ensured and participation is broader than in formal physical meetings. After months of remote meetings, the European Council was able to convene again in person on 17-21 July 2020 when EU leaders discussed and reached a political agreement on the MFF and the recovery package. In the first half of 2021, EU Heads of State or Government were back online as the third wave of coronavirus hit Europe, but were able to meet in person again in June and October 2021. https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/04/23/conclusions-by-president-charles-michel-following-the-video-conference-with-members-of-the-european-council-on-23-april-2020/https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/can-the-eu-be-run-by-videolink-confidentiality-is-the-biggest-problem/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45109/210720-euco-final-conclusions-en.pdf", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/04/23/conclusions-by-president-charles-michel-following-the-video-conference-with-members-of-the-european-council-on-23-april-2020/https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/can-the-eu-be-run-by-videolink-confidentiality-is-the-biggest-problem/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45109/210720-euco-final-conclusions-en.pdf", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/eight-countries-led-by-austria-slam-calls-to-loosen-eu-fiscal-rules/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=dc2c9a0237-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_09_10_05_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-dc2c9a0237-189747361", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eight-countries-led-by-austria-slam-calls-to-loosen-eu-fiscal-rules/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=dc2c9a0237-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_09_10_05_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-dc2c9a0237-189747361", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/porto-summit-11-eu-countries-national-authority/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/porto-summit-11-eu-countries-national-authority/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-australia-trade-deal-runs-aground-over-submarine-furor/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-australia-trade-deal-runs-aground-over-submarine-furor/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-taxation-united-states-digital-tax-corporate-tax/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-taxation-united-states-digital-tax-corporate-tax/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/oecd-global-tax-deal-reached-g20/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/oecd-global-tax-deal-reached-g20/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-giants-new-appeal-to-governments-please-regulate-us-11580126502", "matched_news_url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-giants-new-appeal-to-governments-please-regulate-us-11580126502", "matched_news_outlet": "The Wall Street Journal"}], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "of discussions oncurrent legislative acts, such as the Data GovernanceAct, Roaming, and the updated privacy rules forelectronic communications ePrivacy.

Russia's war on Ukraine, which was launched while this study was being drafted, shows us not just the added value of concerted action by the Union but also the ability of EU institutions and Member States to find new and effective solutions to deal with major shocks. This paper, the first in an annual series, seeks to assess the risks to, and capabilities and resilience of, the EU system. Building on a review of global risks, it considers in detail specific risks with the potential to harm Europe and its people. It then sets out options for policy responses which can ensure Europe is more able to address the dangers of such risks and minimise the potential damage.

The EPF consists of two pillars, namely 'military operations' and 'assistance measures'. It benefits from an envelope of nearly \u20ac6 billion for the period 2021-2027, funded by the EU Member States (except Denmark) 2 on a gross national income (GNI) basis. Prior to the start of the war, the Council pledged to provide \u20ac31 million in assistance to support the Ukrainian armed forces under the EPF, and similar decisions targeted Bosnia and Herzegovina (\u20ac10 million), Georgia (\u20ac11.4 million) and Moldova (\u20ac6.3 million). After the start of the war, the amount for Ukraine was increased by \u20ac500 million, of which \u20ac450 million for lethal arms and \u20ac50 million for non-lethal supplies, and political agreements were reached for two further increases of \u20ac500 million (thus totalling \u20ac1.5 billion). As EPF implementation begins, the question of the accountability of the money spent could progressively arise; this issue could be addressed by bringing the EPF into the EU budget and hence under the scrutiny of the European Parliament. https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_ATA(2022)698906 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/athena/ https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/es/ip_19_3432 https://ec.europa.eu/fpi/what-we-do/european-peace-facility_en https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021D2135&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021D1923&qid=1644941865989 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021D2134&qid=1644941865989 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021D2136&qid=1644941865989 https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-ukraine-russia-funding-weapons-budget-military-aid/ https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/fac/2022/03/21/ https://www.ceps.eu/the-european-peace-facility/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-ukraine-russia-funding-weapons-budget-military-aid/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Under the Biden administration, the USA and the EU have together launched or revived vehicles for democracy-to-democracy cooperation on the pandemic, the climate, trade, security and democracy.

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the EU decided to cut out its dependency on Russian fossil fuels, and the Commission is to present by mid- May 2022 a phasing-out plan by 2027. By supporting the twin transition, which would include more home-grown renewables and a higher of nuclear power, the EU could further reduce its energy dependency on fossil fuels. However, it will have to assess the impact of nuclear power on raw material imports, such as uranium, for which Russia is currently the EU's second biggest supplier, being outranked recently by Niger (the difference in quantities supplied is negligible, less than 1 %). https://www.politico.eu/article/moldova-wins-gazpr-contract-after-shortage-prompts-emergency-measures/ https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_STU(2020)652096 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2022)699488 https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1502288794929831939 https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecoap/about-eco-innovation/policies-matters/green-and-digital-twin-transition-also-spurs-inclusive-eco_en https://euratom-supply.ec.europa.eu/index_en", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/moldova-wins-gazpr-contract-after-shortage-prompts-emergency-measures/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "The EU and other democratic players also face direct threats from non-democracies, chief among them Russia and China, which increasingly act in concert. Russia has begun a war to challenge the existing security order in Europe and democracy in its neighbourhood, and also in Africa, while China uses trade restrictions to bully democracies in Europe and elsewhere that criticise it or offer support for democratic Taiwan. Both Russia and China are leading sources of disinformation aimed at democratic societies in the EU and elsewhere. In developing economies, China challenges EU interests first by using its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to draw developing countries into debt traps in order to acquire rights to infrastructure and resources beyond its borders, and second by providing an alternative, authoritarian model of development. In a world in which hard power still matters and national self-interest prevails, the EU \u2013 which is centred around soft power and is bound to balance the pursuit of its own interests with respect for international values \u2013 has constantly aimed to better leverage its economic and diplomatic influence, coordinate more effectively among its members, and build strategic partnerships with other major democracies and international regional organisations such as the African Union and ASEAN, which commit to democratic principles in their founding treaties. https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-china-oppose-nato-enlargement-vladimir-putin-xi-jinping-ukraine/https://thediplomat.com/2022/02/how-chinas-economic-coercion-is-bringing-lithuania-and-australia-together/https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2022/698917/EPRS_BRI(2022)698917_EN.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/653633/EXPO_STU(2021)653633_EN.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/698824/EPRS_BRI(2021)698824_EN.pdfhttps://carnegieendowment.org/2020/01/08/how-china-is-reshaping-international-development-pub-80703https://www.egmontinstitute.be/content/uploads/2015/12/Strategic-Partnership-Workshop-Report-final.pdf?type=pdf https://ec.europa.eu/international-partnerships/africa-eu-partnership_en https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/eu-asean-strategic-partnership_en", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-china-oppose-nato-enlargement-vladimir-putin-xi-jinping-ukraine/https://thediplomat.com/2022/02/how-chinas-economic-coercion-is-bringing-lithuania-and-australia-together/https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2022/698917/EPRS_BRI(2022)698917_EN.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/653633/EXPO_STU(2021)653633_EN.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/698824/EPRS_BRI(2021)698824_EN.pdfhttps://carnegieendowment.org/2020/01/08/how-china-is-reshaping-international-development-pub-80703https://www.egmontinstitute.be/content/uploads/2015/12/Strategic-Partnership-Workshop-Report-final.pdf?type=pdf", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "In this scenario, political polarisation is here to stay, being inherent to democracies, and populism is one of its unavoidable poles.

Furthermore, their digital transformation has had a profound impact on democratic politics. The disappearance of numerous newspapers, many of them local, has undermined civic engagement and political participation. The spread of social media and online news sources has made information more accessible, but has also contributed to the dissemination of fake news and disinformation. Meanwhile, there is a risk that measures to counter disinformation unnecessarily restrict freedom of expression. Increasing attacks and intimidation against journalists, traditionally considered to occur in authoritarian regimes, are also affecting developed democracies, often provoked and encouraged by populist

Recent developments, including court rulings at both EU and Member State levels alluding to the rule of law, indicate that deep divisions persist in the EU regarding the understanding of democracy and European values; observers argue that the EU's rule of law crisis is still far from being resolved. EU leaders' various discussions have not led to a solution on the issue, but rather postponed direct action at European level for the moment. Consequently, EU leaders might need to return to this topic again in the near future. At their meeting of 24-25 March 2022, the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, urged EU leaders to use the current 'window of opportunity' to find a way forward on the rule of law. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-22-2020-INIT/en/pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694201/EPRS_BRI(2021)694201_EN.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694243/EPRS_BRI(2021)694243_EN.pdfhttps://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-10/cp210192en.pdf https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=244185&pageIndex=0&doclang=FR&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=1699703 https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-legal-eu-court-reprimand-disciplinary-procedure-for-judges/ https://www.politico.eu/article/five-ways-the-eus-democracy-crisis-could-end/ https://eu.boell.org/en/2020/12/18/after-crisis-crisis-rule-law-headache-wont-go-away https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220324IPR26159/this-is-our-moment-president-metsola-to-eu-leaders", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/five-ways-the-eus-democracy-crisis-could-end/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Such changes may make it more difficult to ensure that all workers benefit from fair and dignified working conditions.

This was a sensitive subject, as signified by the differences in language used in the Porto Declaration adopted by EU Leaders and refers to 'defending fair wages', whilst in the Porto Social Commitment signed by social partners, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Portuguese Presidency reads 'supporting decent wages'.

However, they also noted the importance of preserving the level playing and the 'integrity of the single market' whilst maintaining Europe's global competitiveness. The growing use of subsidies worldwide, more particularly the adoption of the US IRA, has caused concern for some in the EU, who see it as discriminatory and a violation of WTO rules, and as having a potentially damaging effect on the EU green tech industry. Despite differing views on how or whether to change State aid policy, the European Council agreed that it was imperative for the EU to be competitive and productive, particularly in sectors connected to the digital and green transitions. The European Council has agreed that State aid policy needs adjusting in order to become simpler, faster and more predictable, allowing for temporary and proportionate support. Finding the correct balance between enabling State aid to support EU industry and preserving the level playing field in the single market will be a key challenge for the EU and its Member States over the coming months. To monitor these developments, the European Council has asked the Commission to report regularly on the impact of State aid policy on the single market as well as on the EU's competitiveness globally. https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2022)743681 https://www.oecd.org/subsidies/ https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/ https://borderlex.net/2023/02/21/think-tank-responding-to-the-united-states-green-tech-subsidies/ https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/why-eu-objects-to-us-green-subsidies-tax-breaks-quicktake?cmpid=BBD012723_BRUS&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=230127&utm_campaign=brussels&leadSource=uverify%20wall https://epthinktank.eu/2023/02/07/outlook-for-the-special-european-council-meeting-of-9-10-february-2023/#:%7E:text=and%20Annastiina%20Papunen.-,EU%20Heads%20of%20State%20or%20Government%20will%20gather%20on%209,migration%20and%20the%20EU%27s%20economy.", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/why-eu-objects-to-us-green-subsidies-tax-breaks-quicktake?cmpid=BBD012723_BRUS&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=230127&utm_campaign=brussels&leadSource=uverify%20wall", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-vows-deal-to-unlock-poland-pandemic-cash-hinges-recovery-fund-covid-19-on-reforms/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=f32adc5d34-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_08_25_02_38&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-f32adc5d34-189688461", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-vows-deal-to-unlock-poland-pandemic-cash-hinges-recovery-fund-covid-19-on-reforms/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=f32adc5d34-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_08_25_02_38&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-f32adc5d34-189688461", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/eight-countries-led-by-austria-slam-calls-to-loosen-eu-fiscal-rules/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=dc2c9a0237-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_09_10_05_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-dc2c9a0237-189747361", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eight-countries-led-by-austria-slam-calls-to-loosen-eu-fiscal-rules/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=dc2c9a0237-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_09_10_05_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-dc2c9a0237-189747361", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Following the Charlie Hebdo attacks, for example, after which millions of people had expressed their solidarity with the victims (through the 'Je suis Charlie' movement), an informal European Council meeting was held on 12 February 2015.

The European Council stated in March 2019 that it looks forward 'to the Commission's recommendation on a concerted approach to the security of 5G networks'. The recommendation was published a few days after the European Council meeting. Since then, the security of 5G networks, and especially the involvement of the Chinese technology giant Huawei in building the networks, has been a widely discussed topic, notably following the move by the US to block Huawei from its market and to encourage its allies to adopt a similar approach. On 29 January 2020, the Commission published the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity, in which it outlined a set of key actions to ensure the security of the networks, such as limiting dependency on a single supplier and assessing the risk profile of supplies. The multivendor approach has been interpreted by Huawei as meaning that it will be able to take part in building the European 5G networks. The Commission has called on the Member States to 'take concrete and measurable steps' to implement key toolbox measures. EU leaders discussed 5G at their meeting on 1-2 October 2020 and stressed that 'potential 5G suppliers need to be assessed on the basis of common objective criteria' and asked the Member States to send their national plans on the roll-out of 5G to the Commission to 'ensure the rapid deployment of 5G across the EU'. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-1-2019-INIT/en/pdf https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154 https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123 https://agenceurope.eu/en/bulletin/article/12414/7 https://huawei.eu/press-release/huawei-media-statement-following-publication-european-commissions-5g-security-toolbox https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_127 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45910/021020-euco-final-conclusions.pdf?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=European+Council+conclusions%2c+1-2+October+2020", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "Union, which closely follows the international agreement with adjustments to ensure compliance with EU law.

Recent developments, including court rulings at both EU and Member State levels alluding to the rule of law, indicate that deep divisions persist in the EU regarding the understanding of democracy and European values; observers argue that the EU's rule of law crisis is still far from being resolved. EU leaders' various discussions have not led to a solution on the issue, but rather postponed direct action at European level for the moment. Consequently, EU leaders might need to return to this topic again in the near future. At their meeting of 24-25 March 2022, the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, urged EU leaders to use the current 'window of opportunity' to find a way forward on the rule of law. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-22-2020-INIT/en/pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694201/EPRS_BRI(2021)694201_EN.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694243/EPRS_BRI(2021)694243_EN.pdfhttps://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-10/cp210192en.pdf https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=244185&pageIndex=0&doclang=FR&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=1699703 https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-legal-eu-court-reprimand-disciplinary-procedure-for-judges/ https://www.politico.eu/article/five-ways-the-eus-democracy-crisis-could-end/ https://eu.boell.org/en/2020/12/18/after-crisis-crisis-rule-law-headache-wont-go-away https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220324IPR26159/this-is-our-moment-president-metsola-to-eu-leaders", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/five-ways-the-eus-democracy-crisis-could-end/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "During the coronavirus crisis, the 'solidarity clause' in Article 122 TFEU has been used as legal basis for some of the actions taken to tackle the crisis and support the EU economy in the recovery process.

However, at the Ecofin meeting in Luxembourg on 5 April 2022, Poland blocked the EU agreement on the OECD minimum corporate tax rate.

Recent developments, including court rulings at both EU and Member State levels alluding to the rule of law, indicate that deep divisions persist in the EU regarding the understanding of democracy and European values; observers argue that the EU's rule of law crisis is still far from being resolved. EU leaders' various discussions have not led to a solution on the issue, but rather postponed direct action at European level for the moment. Consequently, EU leaders might need to return to this topic again in the near future.

Since then, the security of 5G networks, and especially the involvement of the Chinese technology giant Huawei in building the networks, has been a widely discussed topic, notably following the move by the US to block Huawei from its market and to encourage its allies to adopt a similar approach. On 29 January 2020, the Commission published the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity, in which it outlined a set of key actions to ensure the security of the networks, such as limiting dependency on a single supplier and assessing the risk profile of supplies. The multivendor approach has been interpreted by Huawei as meaning that it will be able to take part in building the European 5G networks. The Commission has called on the Member States to 'take concrete and measurable steps' to implement key toolbox measures. EU leaders discussed 5G at their meeting on 1-2 October 2020 and stressed that 'potential 5G suppliers need to be assessed on the basis of common objective criteria' and asked the Member States to send their national plans on the roll-out of 5G to the Commission to 'ensure the rapid deployment of 5G across the EU'. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-1-2019-INIT/en/pdf https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154 https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123 https://agenceurope.eu/en/bulletin/article/12414/7 https://huawei.eu/press-release/huawei-media-statement-following-publication-european-commissions-5g-security-toolbox https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_127 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45910/021020-euco-final-conclusions.pdf?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=European+Council+conclusions%2c+1-2+October+2020", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "The EU supports the abovementioned tax package, even though it has been working on its own digital tax to deal with the issue. In 2018, the European Commission put forward two proposals for fair and effective taxation of the digital economy: a short-term solution, to be delivered by an interim digital services tax on revenues from certain digital services, and a permanent reform of corporate tax rules, based on the concept of 'significant digital presence'. Progress at EU level was stalled in an effort to find a global solution with the OECD. At the July 2020 European Council meeting, EU leaders tasked the Commission with putting forward a proposal on a digital levy in the first semester of 2021, considering ongoing OECD negotiations. As agreed in the interinstitutional agreement of 16 December 2020, such a levy was due to be one of the EU budget's new 'own resources' that would contribute to paying off EU debts incurred to finance the recovery package as well as play an important role in the fair taxation of digital companies. In December 2021, the Commission proposed a directive on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups in the Union, which closely follows the international agreement with adjustments to ensure compliance with EU law. In April 2022 at the Economic and Financial Affairs Council meeting, Poland vetoed the latest compromise proposal by the French Presidency, thereby blocking the file. It has been reported that the file has been blocked as a means to pressure the European Commission into approving the Polish recovery plans. https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_3564https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/company-tax/fair-taxation-digital-economy_enhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45109/210720-euco-final-conclusions-en.pdf https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.LI.2020.433.01.0028.01.ENG https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/long-term-eu-budget/2021-2027/revenue/potential-new-sources-revenue_en https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0823&qid=1641150862839 https://newsroom.consilium.europa.eu/events/20220405-economic-and-financial-affairs-council-april-2022/134695-1-press-conference-part-1-20220405 https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/black-death-rule-of-law-polands-blockade/ https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/poland-blocks-eu-directive-to-implement-global-corporate-tax-deal/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/black-death-rule-of-law-polands-blockade/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "In the strategic agenda, the European Council stated that the EU would continue to update its competition framework, taking into account new technological and global market developments.

The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) was developed as part of the introduction of the euro and was reinforced in the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis. The framework aims to keep countries' deficit below 3 % of economic output and their public debt below 60 %. Current rules allow Member States some leeway to bend the rules and get away without any fines, which could, if applied (not applied until now) amount to 0.2 % of the country's GDP. Eurozone debt decreased slightly to 95.6 % of economic output (88.1 % of GDP in EU as a whole) in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 100 % at the end of the first quarter, with the highest levels reached in Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium and Cyprus. The Commission has relaunched the debate on the review of EU economic governance, which had begun before the pandemic; the crisis led the EU to suspend the rules in March 2020 by activating the so-called general escape clause. This move enabled governments to take a supportive fiscal stance and to support their economies in the face of the economic and social impact of the pandemic. The rules are set to be applied again only in 2023 on the basis of the Commission's spring 2021 economic forecast. https://pro.politico.eu/news/138913 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/14497745/2-22042022-BP-EN.pdf/90896015-2ac1-081a-2eef-ad8d5f2c0da1 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_5374 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/economic-governance-review_en https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2722", "matched_news_url": "https://pro.politico.eu/news/138913", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46764500", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46764500", "matched_news_outlet": "BBC News"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/eu-confidential/politico-eu-confidential-timothy-garton-ash-second-wave-war-on-leaks/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/eu-confidential/politico-eu-confidential-timothy-garton-ash-second-wave-war-on-leaks/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-shooting/french-foreign-leaders-walk-arm-in-arm-as-millions-protest-paris-attacks-idUSKBN0KK05S20150111?utm_source=Facebook", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-shooting/french-foreign-leaders-walk-arm-in-arm-as-millions-protest-paris-attacks-idUSKBN0KK05S20150111?utm_source=Facebook", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-vaccination-europe-live-data-tracker-coverage/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-vaccination-europe-live-data-tracker-coverage/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "In the digital age, earning profit in a country no longer necessarily requires setting-up factories or offices on the ground, but can be effected by offering products or services through digital platforms.

The current preliminary analysis suggests that by 2030, EU action on liability could generate \u20ac54.8 billion in added value for the EU economy by stepping up the level of research and development in AI and in the range of \u20ac498.3 billion if other broader impacts, including reductions in accidents, health and environmental impacts and user impacts are also taken into consideration. A clear and coherent EU civil liability regime for AI has the potential to reduce risks and increase safety, decrease legal uncertainty and related legal and litigation costs, and enhance consumer rights and trust. Those elements together could facilitate the faster and arguably safer uptake and diffusion of AI.

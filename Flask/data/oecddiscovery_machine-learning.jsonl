A limited combination of explanatory variables is chosen from a much larger pool of potential variables that include those that have been most useful in predicting downturns in previous OECD work. The most frequently selected variables are financial variables, especially those relating to credit and house prices, but also include equity prices and various measures of interest rates (such as the slope of the yield curve).

A recent update of the OECD\u2019s Product Market Regulation indicator for Costa Rica shows that there is ample room to improve regulations. Costa Rica\u2019s economic development is hindered by heavy state involvement and high barriers to entry, compared to both OECD countries and regional peers. This paper discusses options to improve product market regulations, based on international best practices. Regulatory reform can improve consumer welfare by boosting competition and thus lowering prices of key goods and services, which in turn increases the purchasing power of low-income households and reduces poverty. By raising productivity, stronger competition will also allow higher wages.

Vaccination is very powerful at reducing virus transmission: fully vaccinating 20% of the population is estimated to have the same effect as closing down public transport and all-but-essential workplaces; fully vaccinating 50% of the population would have a larger effect than simultaneously applying all forms of containment policies in their most extreme form (closure of workplaces, public transport and schools, restrictions on travel and gatherings and stay-at-home requirements).

Effective child well-being policies can bring high long-term returns on early life investments and public interventions. However, these benefits are not fully understood and thus do not always receive the necessary political attention in public policy making. Mobilising evidence to support effective policies for child well-being is crucial, especially as responsibilities for such policies tend to be fragmented across government departments and levels of government. Therefore, organisations such as knowledge brokers, which help ensure that evidence is shared with those responsible for designing and implementing public policies, have a critical role to play in improving the effectiveness of child well-being policies and practices. They can help make evidence accessible, trustworthy, and understandable, so that it has the greatest impact on policy.

Next, it examines the temporal character of market operations and the timing of their changes in their operational status, including market closures, with respect to the seasonality of agricultural production and land use in northeastern Nigeria.

This high uncertainty is reflected in the debate on the possibility of a \u201csecular stagnation\u201d, fueled by the short-lived Information and Communication Technology (ICT) shock and the current low productivity and GDP growth in advanced countries. Our projection tool allows for the modelling of technology shocks, for different speeds of regulation and education convergence, with endogenous capital growth and TFP convergence processes.\nWe illustrate the benefits of this tool through four growth scenarios, crossing the cases of a new technology shock or secular stagnation with those of regulation and education convergence or of absence of reforms. Over the period 2015-2100, the secular stagnation scenario assumes yearly TFP growth of 0.6% in the US, leading to a 1.5% GDP growth trend.

However, as in other OECD countries, there is scope to improve equal access to opportunities across the population. Poverty risks are high for the unemployed and the low-skilled. Vulnerable socio-demographics, in particular the low educated, single mothers and people with a migrant background and with disabilities have persistently low incomes. Moreover, low-income households are overburdened by housing costs. To foster upward income mobility, employment should be increased among vulnerable groups by enhancing skills through life-long learning, effective career guidance and continuing to strengthen work incentives.

Fiscal and monetary support measures were rapidly deployed and there remains space for further policy support, if needed. However, with the shuttering of many businesses, unemployment has surged and many have left the labour force. Bringing people back into work quickly is important as the recession risks leaving behind a long-lasting negative economic impact. Occupational licensing and non-compete agreements are impediments to moving to new employers. Low-skilled workers and disadvantaged groups tend to be particularly affected by these barriers. A further barrier to labour mobility is housing market regulation.

The number of people living in cities increased from 5 million in 1950 to 133 million in 2010. During the same period, the number of towns and cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants grew from 159 to close to 2 000. A large majority of these agglomerations are secondary cities and small towns that act as hubs and catalysts for local and regional production and supply chains, as well as for the transfer of goods, people and information, linking the local and regional economies to the global economy. The intensity of the spatial interactions of cities has strongly increased with population growth, urbanisation and higher urban density.

Using the Aglink-Cosimo model, this stochastic scenario analysis sheds light on the complex relationships between trade and food security in an environment where extreme weather events create uncertainty.

Although no model can capture the complex process and consequences of opening this sector to trade, it is clear that trade integration needs to be part of a wider coherent policy package to improve

Problematic opioid use is also spreading in other OECD countries, due to the upward trend of prescription opioid use and the complexities of the illegal drug supply. This report presents evidence on the magnitude of problematic opioid use across OECD countries, describes the main drivers, and identifies a set of policy actions to address them. The report highlights the opioid crisis as a complex public health issue that requires a comprehensive approach across all sectors, including health, social services, and law enforcement. Strong health information systems are also needed, particularly data and research. Preventing problematic opioid use requires a combination of policies that ensure more information is provided to patients and health care practitioners, while providing access to appropriate pa...",

The policy aims at creating a more favourable environment for small innovative start-ups through a number of complementary instruments, including \u201cfast-track\u201d and zero cost incorporation, simplified insolvency procedures, tax incentives for equity investments, and a public guarantee scheme for bank credit. While the report focuses only on Italy, the \u201cStart-up Act\u201d can be seen as a very useful \u201claboratory\u201d to inform policies for innovative entrepreneurship across OECD member countries. The evaluation highlights that the impact of the policy on beneficiary firms has been positive overall, but that complementary policy actions in other areas are required in order to further realise the full potential of Italian innovative start-ups.", "published_on": "2018-09-26", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/02ab0eb7-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail":

It investigates how cognitive and non-cognitive skills are rewarded in digital vs. less digital intensive industries and assesses the extent to which skills bundles matter. The results indicate that digital intensive industries especially reward workers having relatively higher levels of self-organisation and advanced numeracy skills. Moreover, for workers in digital intensive industries, bundles of skills are particularly important: workers endowed with a high level of numeracy skills receive an additional wage premium, if they also show high levels of self-organisation or managing and communication skills.", "published_on": "2018-04-23", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9a9479b5-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/406d7f5dfe7381084cf2f2e5dee3558b.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/406d7f5dfe7381084cf2f2e5dee3558b.png", "topics": ["Economy", "Information Age", "Automation", "Big Five personality traits", "Dependent and independent variables", "Human capital", "Numeracy", "Employment", "Standard error", "Variance", "Fixed effects model", "Coefficient of determination", "Labour economics", "Regression analysis", "Errors and residuals", "Ordinary least squares", "Dummy variable (statistics)", "Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies", "Economic inequality", "Education", "Literacy", "Economics", "P-value", "Productivity", "Information and communications technology", "Information technology", "Information", "Technology", "Thomas Lemieux", "Market (economics)", "Causes of income inequality in the United States", "Branches of science", "Daron Acemoglu", "Science", "Cognition"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["science and technology>social sciences", "science and technology", "labour", "science and technology>social sciences>psychology", "science and technology>social sciences>economics"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Working paper", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/9a9479b5-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1162/003355398555883", "title": "Technology and Changes in Skill Structure: Evidence from Seven OECD Countries", "journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/5jlzfl2p5rzq-en", "title": "Returns to ICT Skills", "journal": "OECD Education Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/cdb5de9b-en", "title": "Skills and global value chains", "journal": "OECD Science, Technology and Industry Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264258051-en", "title": "Skills Matter", "journal": "OECD Skills Studies", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.3386/w7136", "title": "Information Technology, Workplace Organization and the Demand for Skilled Labor: Firm-Level Evidence", "publisher": "National Bureau of Economic Research"}, {"doi": "10.3982/ecta6551", "title": "Estimating the Technology of Cognitive and Noncognitive Skill Formation", "journal": "Econometrica", "publisher": "The Econometric Society"}, {"doi": "10.2139/ssrn.2471066", "title": "Do Personality Traits Affect Productivity?

The indicators used to classify 36 ISIC revision 4 sectors over the period 2001-15 are: share of ICT tangible and intangible (i.e. software) investment; share of purchases of intermediate ICT goods and services; stock of robots per hundreds of employees; share of ICT specialists in total employment; and the share of turnover from online sales.

For designing policies to support displaced workers, it is crucial to better understand the cost of job loss, whether there are specific effects of being displaced from a carbon-intensive sector and which workers are most at risk. By using German administrative labour market data and focusing on mass layoff events, we estimate the cost of involuntary job displacement for workers in high carbon-intensity sectors and compare it with the displacement costs for workers in low carbon-intensity sectors. We find that displaced workers from high carbon-intensity sectors have, on average, higher earnings losses and face stronger difficulties in finding a new job and recovering their earnings. Our results indicate that this is mainly due to human capital specificity, the regional clustering of carbon-intensive activities and higher wage premia in carbon-intensive firms.

This paper provides a re-assessment of job mobility in the United States during 2000-2018, based on a novel administrative data source covering almost all workers and job flows. First, aggregate job hire and job separation rates have declined over time, especially in the 2000s. This is mainly driven by flows into and out of nonemployment, while job-to-job hires during 2016-2018 had recovered to their peak levels prior to the global financial crisis. Examination of job mobility across different individual and firm-level characteristics shows comparatively higher job-to-job flows for youth, the less educated, non-whites and individuals working in young firms. In addition, observed job movers in these groups experience the largest earnings gain on average from job-to-job changes. Second, a spatial look at job mobility shows net job-to-job flows towards Western and Southern States.

While domestic actors bear an increasing share of the national health expenditure in this process, the transition is not automatic nor necessarily smooth. The challenges that emerge in the process are recently exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis, which risks diverting resources away from basic health services. The role of development actors during this stage can be critical in setting up sustainable systems of health financing in those countries. The paper starts with a review of the progress on the global health agenda by taking stock of past achievements and remaining challenges.

Yet, so far there has been no consensus of what a city really is. Substantial differences in the way cities, metropolitan, urban, and rural areas are defined across countries hinder robust international comparisons and an accurate monitoring of SDGs. The report Cities in the World: A New Perspective on Urbanisation addresses this void and provides new insights on urbanisation by applying for the first time two new definitions of human settlements to the entire globe: the Degree of Urbanisation and the Functional Urban Area. Based on the definitions, the report presents new evidence of recent and future urbanisation trends and sheds light on the evolution of metropolitan areas around the globe.

Employment rates remain low, reflecting barriers to finding a job such as low levels of skills and weak work incentives.

To what extent do the start-up and scale-up contributions and obstacles vary by sector, and what is in common across sectors? This report examines the entrepreneurial ecosystems of three of Denmark's sector strongholds, sectors where future growth is likely to be generated - advanced production, energy technology and food and bio resources. A focus on Denmark includes the scale and nature of start-ups and scale-ups in different sectors, the bottlenecks, the current policies and how they can be refined.

While in most OECD countries the majority of such services are delivered by public employment services, in two in five OECD and EU countries (or regions) they are partly or fully contracted out to external providers, including for-profit and not-for-profit entities. Contracting out employment services to outside providers offers many potential benefits: an increased flexibility to scale capacity in line with changes in unemployment, the possibility of offering services more cost-effectively, the option to better tailor services through the use of specialised service providers and the possibility to offer jobseekers choice of providers. However, achieving these benefits will depend on the actual design and monitoring of the contracting arrangements that are put in place.

The report also analyses the issue of fragmented climate policies in the broader perspective of the trade-climate nexus and discusses how other policy measures \u2013 especially those related to trade

The indicator currently includes 12 OECD Member Countries and covers the period 1990-2018. The index spikes near major political events and during major discussions around potentially significant climate policy changes. Using a global firm-level dataset, the empirical analysis shows that Climate Policy Uncertainty is associated with economically and statistically significant decreases in investment, particularly in pollution-intensive sectors that are most exposed to climate policies, and among capital-intensive companies. In addition to annual series, the study also provides the indicator at higher frequencies of monthly and quarterly levels, and develops sub-indices that capture the direction of climate policy uncertainty associated with a strengthening or a weakening of climate policies for a sub-set of countries.", "published_on": "2022-08-26", "added_on": "2022-08-29", "document_url":

In the Digital SUTs framework, three dimensions are introduced for measuring the digital economy: the nature of the transaction (the \u201chow\u201d), the goods and services produced (the \u201cwhat\u201d), and the new digital industries (the \u201cwho\u201d).

The review makes clear that exposure to pollutants and high temperatures has economically meaningful costs for both individuals and societies, stemming from lower human capital accumulation. Furthermore, the evidence presented indicates that adverse environmental conditions have large distributional consequences, leading to widening disparities in educational opportunities both across countries and across socio-economic groups within-countries.

In 2021 the average nuclear power plant had already been operating for 31 years and some 30% of reactors worldwide were already operating under long-term operation conditions. The long-term operation of this existing nuclear capacity will be essential over the next decade to keep decarbonisation targets within reach. At the same time, by keeping the long-term-operation option open, countries could also reap a wide-range of socio-economic benefits including more affordable and secure electricity supply. Nevertheless, an increasing number of reactors are being shut down earlier than expected due to policy decisions and increasing market pressures in some regions.In light of these trends, this study takes a holistic approach to identifying the key enablers for long-term operation of nuclear power plants. The attractiveness of long-term operation lies in its technical maturity, cost-competiveness and e...", "published_on": "2021-07-29", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url":

Although the analysis reveals large differences between countries, a number of general patterns emerge. First, income, consumption and wealth are partially correlated, with the association being stronger in the tails of the joint distribution than around its middle. Second, risk of poverty goes beyond income, with asset and consumption risk of poverty being widespread, especially among some population groups. Third, a large share of households spend more than they earn. This is corroborated by negative median saving rates for households in the bottom income quintile.

The report compares gender gaps in labour and educational outcomes in Colombia with other countries. Particular attention is put on the uneven distribution of unpaid work, and the extra burden this places on women. It investigates how policies and programmes in Colombia can make this distribution more equitable. The first part of the report reviews the evidence on gender gaps and on what causes these, including the role played by attitudes. The second part develops a comprehensive framework to address these challenges, presenting a broad range of options to reduce the unpaid work burden falling on women, and to increase women\u2019s labour income.

A range of challenges need to be addressed and different policy tools can help in this respect. For this purpose the national intellectual property (IP) system can play a pivotal role. This review assesses how Malaysian's national IP system promotes innovation and offers recommendations to improve the design of the system. It does so by analysing the organisation and governance of Malaysia's IP system as well as opportunities and challenges for different local users - ranging from small businesses to frontier companies and public research institutions. Moreover, the review discusses the state of IP markets in Malaysia and related policies and provides a comprehensive set of statistics describing the use of IP in Malaysia in recent years.",

It has achieved robust output growth, rising employment and improving well-being, although inflation has surged. Integration into the euro- and Schengen areas at the start of 2023 are testament to progress, and are providing a further fillip to the economy. Ensuring that fiscal policy is counter-cyclical and that lending supports productive investments can help contain inflationary pressures and sustain growth.

While the economy swiftly rebounded from the pandemic due to strong policy support, it exposed structural weaknesses such as a large informal sector and stark regional disparities in accessing public services. More recently, growth has slowed, and inflation remains high but declining. Looking ahead, main challenges for boosting productivity and investment include strengthening competition, improving regulations, diversifying exports, and enhancing infrastructure. Improvements in governance and the rule of law are essential pillars for achieving sustainable long-term growth and social cohesion. Expanding access to quality education, reducing social contributions, particularly for low-income workers, and providing a same basic level of universal social protection for all workers, formal and informal alike, would help reducing widespread informality and inequities.

The region benefits from two distinct mining subsectors, each with a rich network of suppliers that are relevant for local development: the metallic mining sector (e.g. copper and zinc), which accounts for most of the regional mining production, and the non-metallic sector (ornamental rocks, aggregates and industrial minerals), which is highly dispersed across the territory. The regional mining value chain has the potential to leverage the increasing global and EU demand for sustainable raw materials and thus become a frontrunner in leading technologies and circular processes for environmentally sustainable mining. This study identifies how Andalusia can build on its strengths and address current and future challenges to improve regional productivity and well-being while accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy and assisting EU climate goals.", "published_on": "2021-06-11", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/47062327-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/b3d9e90b7401995f43ef25809556bda5.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/b3d9e90b7401995f43ef25809556bda5.png", "topics": ["Province of C\u00e1diz", "Entrepreneurship", "Competition (economics)", "Infrastructure", "Dependency ratio", "Economy", "European Green Deal", "Small and medium-sized enterprises", "Employment", "Labour economics", "European Union", "Innovation", "Unemployment", "Spain", "Economic growth", "Productivity", "Gross domestic product", "Quality of life", "Mining", "Sustainability", "Andalusia", "Low-carbon economy", "Climate change mitigation", "Value chain", "Seville", "Cyprus", "Education", "Sustainable energy", "Workforce", "Demographic dividend", "Strategy", "Fossil fuel", "Economics", "Automation", "Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008", "Portugal", "Human migration", "Goal", "OECD", "Tourism"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "labour", "economy, business and finance>economy", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>energy and resource", "education", "environment", "science and technology", "labour>unemployment"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/47062327-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.3390/min9110653;oliveira,d.etal.(2020[16]),\u201cmineralsustainabilityoftheportuguesesectoroftheiberianpyritebelt\u201d,comunica\u00e7\u00f5esgeol\u00f3gicas,vol.107/3,pp.11-20;amils,r.,d.fern\u00e1ndez-remolarandtheipbslteam(n.d.[17])", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1787/region-data-enon27january2020)", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1007/s11747-012-0308-3", "title": "Critical service logic: making sense of value creation and co-creation", "journal": "Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science", "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC"}, {"doi": "10.2769/74549", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1080/00343404.2018.1502422;crescenzi,r.(n.d.[21])", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1080/00343404.2021.1899157", "title": "Regions on course for the Fourth Industrial Revolution: the role of a strong indigenous T-KIBS sector", "journal": "Regional Studies", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1787/04440101-en", "title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19): SME policy responses", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.respol.2015.07.003", "title": "Do inventors talk to strangers?

A key question is: What are the plausible scenarios for the evolution of plastics in the absence of additional measures and, as well, with scaled-up policy action? The Global Plastics Outlook: Policy Scenarios to 2060 provides such a forward-looking perspective. The report presents a set of coherent projections on plastics to 2060, including plastics use, waste as well as the environmental impacts linked to plastics, especially leakage to the environment. Such an outlook on plastics can help policy makers understand the scale of the challenge to transition to a more sustainable and circular use of plastics and the need for additional policy action. By identifying two policy packages to bend the plastic curve, the Outlook allows for a better understanding of the environmental benefits and economic consequences of adopting stringent policies.

While Norway enjoys a high level of food security and is meeting its aim of maintaining agricultural production across the country, both environmental performance and the efficient creation of value added along the food chain are compromised by support policies linked to production levels. Support to producers relative to gross farm receipts is the highest among OECD countries, with 59% of farmers\u2019 revenues coming from government support. Only 3% of total support to agriculture is dedicated to research and innovation. Moreover, while Norway has strong public research institutions and well-designed tax deductions, the private sector lacks the right policy incentives to innovate.This review proposes a new policy approach, centred around innovations that would enable Norway to achieve its objectives and improve the productivity, sustainability and resilience of its agro-food sector.

The evidence in this volume shows that around one third of overall wage inequality can be explained by gaps in pay between firms rather than differences in the level and returns to workers\u2019 skills. Gaps in firm pay reflect differences in productivity and wage setting power. To address high wage inequality while fostering high and sustainable growth, worker-centred policies (e.g. education, adult learning) need to be complemented with firm-oriented policies. This involves notably: (1) policies that promote the productivity catch-up of lagging firms, which would not only raise aggregate productivity and wages but also reduce wage inequality; (2) policies that reduce wage gaps at given productivity gaps without limiting efficiency-enhancing reallocation, especially the promotion of worker mobility; and (3) policies that re...", "published_on": "2021-12-09", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/7d9b2208-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/16dabb8e732fc0ea4d1c7cbe5c6b15b6.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/16dabb8e732fc0ea4d1c7cbe5c6b15b6.png", "topics": ["Labour economics", "Gender pay gap", "Economic inequality", "Employment", "Productivity", "Minimum wage", "Economic growth", "Market (economics)", "Remote work", "Non-compete clause", "Herfindahl\u2013Hirschman Index", "Self-employment", "Collective bargaining", "Parental leave", "Economy", "Economics", "Market concentration", "Outsourcing", "Gender", "Variance", "Competition", "Market power", "Education", "Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics", "Collusion", "Social mobility", "OECD", "Tax", "Covariance"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["labour>labour relations", "economy, business and finance", "labour>labour relations>collective contract", "education>school", "labour", "economy, business and finance>economy", "education", "science and technology", "labour>labour relations>collective contract>contract issue-wages", "labour>employment", "education>school>further education"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/7d9b2208-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.3386/w27096", "title": "Employer Policies and the Immigrant-Native Earnings Gap", "publisher": "National Bureau of Economic Research"}, {"doi": "10.1787/63629cc9-en", "title": "The Best versus the Rest", "journal": "OECD Productivity Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/2069b6a3-en", "title": "The Multiprod project", "journal": "OECD Science, Technology and Industry Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/1fd2da34-en", "title": "Negotiating Our Way Up", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.17863/cam.41764", "title": "What Firms Do: Gender Inequality in Linked Employer-Employee Data", "publisher": "Apollo - University of Cambridge Repository"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9ee00155-en", "title": "OECD Employment Outlook 2019", "journal": "OECD Employment Outlook", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264308817-en", "title": "Good Jobs for All in a Changing World of Work", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1086/684045", "title": "It\u2019s Where You Work: Increases in the Dispersion of Earnings across Establishments and Individuals in the United States", "journal": "Journal of Labor Economics", "publisher": "University of Chicago Press"}, {"doi": "10.1787/a5d52e99-en", "title": "Productivity gains from teleworking in the post COVID-19 era: How can public policies make it happen?", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/52ab4e26-en", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.5255/ukda-sn-6689-12", "title": "Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, 1997-2018: Secure Access", "publisher": "UK Data Service"}, {"doi": "10.2139/ssrn.3949832", "title": "Does Pay Transparency Affect the Gender Wage Gap?

The region has many advantages and much potential, but some of this was squandered during the boom years of the 2000s. The studies contained in this volume demonstrate that the potential is still there and that the measures that need to be taken to realise that potential are feasible and affordable. Some of them can have an almost immediate effect, such as easing access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises and opening up new markets for the region\u2019s goods.

It finds that in rural Qu\u00e9bec, both population and personal income are growing, on average, and the province\u2019s economic base continues to diversify. Land occupancy is more homogenous than in the rest of Canada, due to the presence of denser networks of small and medium-sized communities. However, mirroring the situation at the national level, the province displays large regional disparities. The sustainability of some rural communities, especially if remote and resource-based, is challenged by demographic and economic decline. In this context, Qu\u00e9bec has developed one of the most advanced rural policy approaches in the OECD, closely in line with the framework suggested in the OECD\u2019s New Rural Paradigm. The province\u2019s rural policy does not have a sectoral focus, and aims at community empowerment and land occupancy.

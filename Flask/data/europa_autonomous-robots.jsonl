The use of PPPs is a cause of health, environmental and public concerns, and a key question is whether their use can be reduced while maintaining adequate yields. This study provides an overview and description of current and new crop protection practices, including mechanical techniques, plant breeding, biocontrol, induced resistance, applying ecological principles, precision agriculture (PA), and emerging plant protection products. The potential and impact of the new crop protection practices is assessed. It may be feasible to design resilient systems that are economically viable, have limited environmental impact and help improve biodiversity. Diverse cropping systems would have a natural resilience to weeds, pests, and diseases, and potentially reduce the dependency on PPPs, enabled by PA technologies.

This report examines the impacts of the changing contours of labour supply on the employment structure over the last quarter-century in Europe (1995&#8211;2019). The primary focus is on gender, with a secondary focus on ageing. Among the main findings are that employment shares in gender-balanced jobs have declined despite the rising female share of employment and that gender pay gaps are highest in well-paid jobs.", "published_on": "2021-12-30", "added_on": "2022-05-31", "document_url": "https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/688ee221-84a4-11ec-8c40-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=688ee221-84a4-11ec-8c40-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/91c8ec660938974e71ec86627e4bd58d.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/91c8ec660938974e71ec86627e4bd58d.png", "topics": ["Economy", "Care work", "Quantile", "Working poor", "Sweden", "Breadwinner model", "Occupational segregation", "Human migration", "Sex segregation", "Ageing", "Productivity", "Demography", "Woman", "Education", "Household income in the United States", "Gender", "Economic growth", "Market (economics)", "Population pyramid", "Unemployment", "European Union", "Demographic transition", "Labour economics", "Employment", "Gender pay gap", "Parental leave", "Construction", "Total fertility rate", "Life expectancy", "Great Recession", "Glass ceiling", "Organization", "Workforce", "Racial segregation in the United States", "2004 enlargement of the European Union", "Human capital", "Sub-replacement fertility", "Discrimination", "Part-time job", "Economics", "Teacher", "Health", "Economic inequality", "Population", "Causes of income inequality in the United States", "Europe", "Fertility", "Immigration", "Branches of science", "Social equality", "Recession", "Gender equality", "Information and communications technology", "Division of labour", "Correlation", "Unpaid work", "Economic development", "Demand", "Spain"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "labour", "labour>employment", "economy, business and finance>economy", "science and technology", "politics"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["Catalogue number TJ-AN-20-001-EN-N", "10.2806/16416", "9789289722391", "ISSN 2363-0833"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2838/978935", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2760/391659", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2806/997207", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2839/29540", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2839/509", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264281318-en", "title": "The Pursuit of Gender Equality", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.2785/796328", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2839/595585", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2838/58639", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1787/empl_outlook-2002-4-en", "title": "Women at Work", "journal": "OECD Employment Outlook 2016", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1017/dem.2014.9", "title": "BECKER AND THE DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION", "journal": "Journal of Demographic Economics", "publisher": "Cambridge University Press (CUP)"}, {"doi": "10.1111/j.1728-4457.2015.00024.x", "title": "Re-theorizing Family Demographics", "journal": "Population and Development Review", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.2307/1972499", "title": "Cultural Dynamics and Economic Theories of Fertility Change", "journal": "Population and Development Review", "publisher": "JSTOR"}, {"doi": "10.1186/s41118-020-00077-4", "title": "The second demographic transition, 1986\u20132020: sub-replacement fertility and rising cohabitation\u2014a global update", "journal": "Genus", "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC"}, {"doi": "10.5465/amp.2007.24286161", "title": "The Gender Pay Gap", "journal": "Academy of Management Perspectives", "publisher": "Academy of Management"}, {"doi": "10.1093/sf/sox087", "title": "Segregation across Workplaces and the Motherhood Wage Gap: Why Do Mothers Work in Low-Wage Establishments?", "journal": "Social Forces", "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}, {"doi": "10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199680962.001.0001", "title": "Occupational Change in Europe", "publisher": "Oxford University Press"}, {"doi": "10.2307/2525981", "title": "Male-Female Wage Differentials in Urban Labor Markets", "journal": "International Economic Review", "publisher": "JSTOR"}, {"doi": "10.1177/0950017020946567", "title": "\u2018Good\u2019 Bad Jobs?

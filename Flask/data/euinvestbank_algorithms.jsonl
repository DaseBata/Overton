Whilst we find evidence for complete bond market integration, the market for bank loans remains segmented, albeit to various degrees depending on the type and size of the loan. Factor analysis reveals that rates on large loans and small loans with long rate fixation periods have weakly converged in the sense that, up to a fixed effect, their evolution is driven by common factors only. In contrast, the price evolution of small loans with short rate fixation periods is still affected by country-specific dynamic factors. There are few signs that bank loan rates are becoming more uniform with time.", "published_on": "2009-11-30", "added_on": "2023-01-22", "document_url": "https://www.eib.org/publications/efr-2009-v01", "pdf_url": "https://www.eib.org/attachments/efs/efr_2009_v01_en.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/euinvestbank/0ff6b0ca7c090cc229c1e21d79a25034.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/euinvestbank/0ff6b0ca7c090cc229c1e21d79a25034.png", "topics": ["Money", "Economy", "Finance", "Bond market", "Debt", "Errors and residuals", "Factor analysis", "European Central Bank", "Interest rate", "Dummy variable (statistics)", "Ordinary least squares", "Loan", "Market (economics)", "Stationary process", "Augmented Dickey\u2013Fuller test", "Bond credit rating", "Bank", "Unit root", "Dickey\u2013Fuller test", "Interest", "Euro", "Inflation", "Bond (finance)", "Risk", "Regression analysis", "Market liquidity", "Eurozone", "Information asymmetry", "Yield (finance)", "Credit rating", "Statistical significance", "European Investment Bank", "Yield to maturity", "Economics", "Linear regression", "P-value", "Standard deviation", "Monetary policy", "Parameter", "Economic growth", "Statistics", "Variance", "Price", "Econometrics", "Securitization", "Dependent and independent variables", "Swap (finance)"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>financial and business service", "science and technology>social sciences", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>financial and business service>banking", "science and technology>mathematics", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economy", "science and technology>social sciences>economics"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": [], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1080/00036846.2011.617697", "title": "Impact of bank competition on the interest rate pass-through in the euro area", "journal": "Applied Economics", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.2307/1879431", "title": "The Market for \"Lemons\": Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism", "journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}, {"doi": "10.1006/jfin.2000.0282", "title": "Relationship Banking: What Do We Know?", "journal": "Journal of Financial Intermediation", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.jbankfin.2003.10.014", "title": "Productivity change in European banking: A comparison of parametric and non-parametric approaches", "journal": "Journal of Banking & Finance", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1006/jfin.1999.0278", "title": "Relationship Lending within a Bank-Based System: Evidence from European Small Business Data", "journal": "Journal of Financial Intermediation", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1080/01621459.1979.10482531", "title": "Distribution of the Estimators for Autoregressive Time Series with a Unit Root", "journal": "Journal of the American Statistical Association", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1214/aos/1176344552", "title": "Bootstrap Methods: Another Look at the Jackknife", "journal": "The Annals of Statistics", "publisher": "Institute of Mathematical Statistics"}, {"doi": "10.1080/1351847032000143422", "title": "Which factors affect corporate bonds pricing?

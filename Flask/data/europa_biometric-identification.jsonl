We found that the Commission\u2019s identification of entities as NGOs in its systems is not reliable. We assessed the Commission\u2019s selection of NGO-led projects as generally transparent. However, for some of the audited UN bodies, the selection processes of NGOs were not transparent. The Commission does not always collect and check comprehensive information on all NGOs supported. The information on EU funds implemented by NGOs is published in several systems but the information disclosed is limited.

Since 2014, the European Union has experienced a stark increase in facilitated irregular migration into its territory and, while since 2017 detected irregular crossings into the EU have decreased again, pressures on the external borders of the EU remain important. Within Africa, the smuggling business has thrived over the past years. Each year it generates estimated profits of more than USD 1 billion. Individuals originating from countries of the ECOWAS region represent a significant share of overall irregular migration into the EU and, for the future, the European Boarder and Coast Guard Agency (EBCG) foresees a likely growth in the proportion of West African migrants crossing the border irregularly.6 Migrant smuggling services are offered when individuals seek ways to overcome barriers and when demand for emigration or immigration does not correspond to available opportunities for legal migration.7 Migrant smugglers do however, not only respond to demand from potential migrants, but also play a large role in amplifying the scale of irregular movement and exposing vulnerable migrants to exploitation and life-threatening situations. From the perspective of migrants and refugees, smugglers may be their only hope to escape conflict and hardships. Yet, particularly in the Sahel and in Northern Africa, migrant smuggling networks exploiting migrants in vulnerable situations, violate their human rights as well as endanger life. The increasing involvement of organised crime networks and the high number of related crimes necessary to facilitate smuggling exacerbates the vulnerability of smuggled migrants.", "published_on": "2018-12-10", "added_on": "2019-07-23", "document_url": "https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/36eb3343-fcf9-11e8-a96d-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://publications.europa.eu/portal2012-portlet/html/downloadHandler.jsp?identifier=36eb3343-fcf9-11e8-a96d-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/7411e8e81ebbd5bf9116b8d6e6309682.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/7411e8e81ebbd5bf9116b8d6e6309682.png", "topics": ["Human trafficking", "People smuggling", "Economic Community of West African States", "Immigration", "United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime", "European Border and Coast Guard Agency", "Identity document", "Smuggling", "United Nations Convention against Corruption", "West Africa", "European Union", "Human activities", "Government", "Politics", "Law", "Organized crime", "Police", "Justice", "The Gambia", "Human migration", "European migrant crisis", "Public sphere", "Transnational organized crime", "Crime", "Ivory Coast", "Culture", "Border control", "Trafficking of children", "Africa", "Ratification", "African Union"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["society>values", "politics", "society", "politics>government", "society>values>corrupt practices"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": [], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.4172/2169-0170.1000154", "title": "ECOWAS Protocol on Free Movement and Trans-border Security in West Africa", "journal": "Journal of Civil & Legal Sciences", "publisher": "OMICS Publishing Group"}, {"doi": "10.1093/afraf/adx007", "title": "Autocracy, migration, and the Gambia's \u2018unprecedented\u2019 2016 election", "journal": "African Affairs", "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}, {"doi": "10.2760/1702", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1080/1369183x.2017.1315522", "title": "Navigating the migration industry: migrants moving through an African-European web of facilitation/control", "journal": "Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.2837/866902", "title": null, "publisher": null}], "policy": [{"overton_id": "jointresearcheu-fac68c800ae96a65570ecd64d0b57cb6", "title": "Many more to come?

The report presents the results of the interim evaluation of the Fund against the five criteria set out in the Better Regulation Guidelines (effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, relevance, and EU added value) plus three additional criteria (sustainability, complementarity of actions, and simplification of administrative burden). Based on the interim evaluation, the Commission shall report to the Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the Fund\u2019s implementation by 30 June 2018, as provided in the legal basis. The study confirms the Fund to be an effective tool towards a common visa policy and an integrated border management across the EU, by making visa processing more timely and efficient and strengthening Member States capacity to monitor and control the EU external borders. Despite some implementation issues, the Fund proved to be overall efficient, with results achieved at a reasonable cost. The evaluation also confirms that priorities and objectives laid down in Regulation (EU) N. 515/2014 are still relevant and aligned to current needs and problems, with no new needs or priorities not properly covered by the Fund. The Fund has proved to be coherent with and complementary to other EU funding instruments and programmes with similar objectives and the national policies in the field of visa and borders. The evaluation found evidence of the EU added value brought by actions and projects supported by the Fund. As regards the Fund\u2019s sustainability, the introduction of specific arrangements at both EU and national level makes it likely that actions will continue when the Fund is over. Finally, compared to the previous programming period, the Fund assured clear progress towards simplification of procedures. Some key issues emerged. Firstly, the administrative burden remains high, particularly due to burdensome monitoring, reporting, and controlling requirements by the European Commission. Secondly, Member States raised problems with the requirement of allocating resources under key EU priority areas that not always correspond to national main priorities. Finally, some problems emerged also with regard to the deployment of human resources, including the low availability of qualified staff within national administration and the difficulties in managing staff involved in different projects at the same time.", "published_on": "2018-11-16", "added_on": "2019-07-23", "document_url": "https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/a24a7508-ebb0-11e8-b690-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://publications.europa.eu/portal2012-portlet/html/downloadHandler.jsp?identifier=a24a7508-ebb0-11e8-b690-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/5e377fdc1846882b18bc0e8d9aa9562e.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/5e377fdc1846882b18bc0e8d9aa9562e.png", "topics": ["Human activities", "Government", "Border control", "Treaty on European Union", "European Commission", "Visa policy of the Schengen Area", "Schengen Area", "European Border and Coast Guard Agency", "European Union", "Treaty of Rome", "Evaluation", "European Parliament", "Politics", "Refugee"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "politics>international relations>diplomacy", "lifestyle and leisure", "lifestyle and leisure>leisure", "politics", "politics>international relations", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>transport", "politics>international relations>diplomacy>treaty", "politics>government", "lifestyle and leisure>leisure>travel"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": [], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2837/552104", "title": null, "publisher": null}], "policy": [{"overton_id": "europa-568fdf7b6803b81cbaecb8300aacd70f", "title": "The basic acts and other regulations of the 2014-2020 home affairs funds : AMIF and ISF.", "policy_source_id": "europa"}, {"overton_id": "eucommission-f72f57e08573b938b587cac4b9758f4f", "title": "Contribution of the European Structural and Investment Funds to the 10 Commission priorities: Migration", "policy_source_id": "eucommission"}], "news": [], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": " Other MS 217 stated that a better border control was supported by measures focused on therenewing of the equipment for border control e.g. work stations, portable computers,border check stamps, communication equipment, copiers, specialised biometric identificationequipment, optronic devices, mobile equipment for border offices and surveillance e.g. USBmicroscopes that allow to verify documents from a distance, aerial vehicles.

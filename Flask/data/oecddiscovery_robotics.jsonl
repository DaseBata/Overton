The findings reveal that shipbuilding relies heavily on intermediate inputs as around 70-80% of the final output value of ship production is generated through supplier sectors. Concerning sourcing activity, China appears to be the most self-sufficient among the four jurisdictions studied, followed by Japan and the EU28, while Korea seems to be more globally integrated. The analysis also explores variations among the four economies in the cost structure of shipbuilding inputs, which might partly be explained by differences in the ship types produced.",

The analysis includes a range of different scenarios based on the recently re-estimated OECD INTERLINK model, in particular its supply-side properties, which illustrate a range of uncertainties and the sensitivity of the adjustment mechanisms to macroeconomic and structural factors. Overall the results suggest that a rise in trend factor productivity will lead to higher levels of production and real income, but employment adjustment will depend on the extent to which the long-run equilibrium of an economy is affected. Though unemployment could rise temporarily, there are important mechanisms present which, if functioning correctly, should prevent any permanent increase in unemployment. The degree of market flexibility is, however, seen as being crucial to the adjustment process, with higher rigidities tending to lengthen the ...", "published_on": "1995-01-01", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/648682381876", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/f18e9863e283d557017dd0706887f58f.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/f18e9863e283d557017dd0706887f58f.png", "topics": ["Macroeconomics", "Economic growth", "Economics", "Inflation", "Employment", "Gross domestic product", "Exchange rate", "Macroeconomic model", "Consumption (economics)", "Crowds", "Economy", "Labour economics", "Economic equilibrium", "Unemployment", "Productivity", "Disinflation", "Interest", "Microeconomics", "Real wages", "Demand", "Nominal rigidity", "New Keynesian economics", "Simulation", "Output (economics)", "Interest rate", "Market (economics)", "Neoclassical economics", "Finance", "Business economics", "Trade"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["science and technology>social sciences", "economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics", "economy, business and finance>economy", "labour>unemployment", "labour", "science and technology>social sciences>economics", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics>inflation", "science and technology"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Working paper", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/648682381876"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1787/215124852050", "title": "Trends and Cycles in Labour Productivity in the Major OECD Countries", "journal": "OECD Economics Department Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/013876245470", "title": "An International Sectoral Data Base for Fourteen OECD Countries (Second Edition)", "journal": "OECD Economics Department Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/067186103828", "title": "Modelling the Supply Side of the Seven Major OECD Economies", "journal": "OECD Economics Department Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/533876774515", "title": "Estimating Potential Output, Output Gaps and Structural Budget Balances", "journal": "OECD Economics Department Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1080/10438599200000010", "title": "The Effects Of New Technologies On Employment", "journal": "Economics of Innovation and New Technology", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}], "policy": [{"overton_id": "oecddiscovery-9937dbd4850e6e8b24369df09f24561c", "title": "Trends and Cycles in Labour Productivity in the Major OECD Countries", "policy_source_id": "oecddiscovery"}, {"overton_id": "oecddiscovery-975e0bc316e0d6f169d71b34511dc590", "title": "An International Sectoral Data Base for Fourteen OECD Countries (Second Edition)", "policy_source_id": "oecddiscovery"}, {"overton_id": "oecddiscovery-6ca4e11a498fa38bf669047ed0c8f8a6", "title": "Modelling the Supply Side of the Seven Major OECD Economies", "policy_source_id": "oecddiscovery"}, {"overton_id": "oecddiscovery-78d9a9cae2e755f6a7bed5f6423fc54c", "title": "Estimating Potential Output, Output Gaps and Structural Budget Balances", "policy_source_id": "oecddiscovery"}], "news": [], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": " No.10.

The paper suggests that these aims can best be achieved through regional approaches for tackling trade-related binding constraints with development finance from a combination of different sources, including providers of South-South co-operation and with engagement of the private sector.", "published_on": "2015-12-07", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrqc6q4xxr5-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/6032f64402def4a764d86159462fbc7f.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/6032f64402def4a764d86159462fbc7f.png", "topics": ["International relations", "Economic development", "World economy", "Economies", "Politics", "International development", "Economy", "Progress", "Global politics", "Trade", "Sustainable development", "Development aid", "Enhanced Integrated Framework", "Developing country", "OECD", "Poverty reduction", "Green growth", "World Trade Organization", "Official development assistance", "Economic growth", "Aid for Trade", "Development Assistance Committee", "Sustainability", "Sustainable Development Goals", "Aid", "Poverty", "South\u2013South cooperation", "Low-carbon economy", "Infrastructure", "Climate resilience", "World Economic Forum", "Public\u2013private partnership", "Competition (economics)", "International Chamber of Commerce", "Business", "Gross domestic product", "Value chain", "Employment", "Export", "Market (economics)", "Aid effectiveness", "Market access"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics", "science and technology>social sciences", "society", "economy, business and finance>economy", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics>international trade", "science and technology>social sciences>economics", "environment", "society>values"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Working paper", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/5jrqc6q4xxr5-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1111/twec.2014.37.issue-4/issuetoc", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264264687-en", "title": "Debate the Issues: New Approaches to Economic Challenges", "journal": "Income Inequality", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264181144-en", "title": "Putting Green Growth at the Heart of Development", "journal": "OECD Green Growth Studies", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264098978-en", "title": "Trade for Growth and Poverty Reduction", "journal": "The Development Dimension", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264117471-en", "title": "Aid for Trade at a Glance 2011", "journal": "Aid for Trade at a Glance 2013", "publisher": "World Trade Organisation"}, {"doi": "10.1787/aid_glance-2013-en", "title": "Aid for Trade at a Glance 2013", "journal": "Aid for Trade at a Glance 2013", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264028609-en", "title": "Aid for Trade", "journal": "The Development Dimension", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264216037-3-en", "title": "Executive summary", "journal": "The Development Dimension", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264112537-en", "title": "Aid for Trade and Development Results", "journal": "The Development Dimension", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1111/j.1467-6435.2012.00531.x", "title": "The Impact of Aid for Trade Facilitation on the Costs of Trading", "journal": "Kyklos", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.09.018", "title": "Does Aid for Trade Really Improve Trade Performance?", "journal": "World Development", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1007/s10290-011-0115-9", "title": "Aid-for-trade facilitation", "journal": "Review of World Economics", "publisher": "Springer Nature"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264069022-en", "title": "Aid for Trade at a Glance 2009", "journal": "Aid for Trade at a Glance 2013", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/aid_glance-2015-en", "title": "Aid for Trade at a Glance 2015", "journal": "Aid for Trade at a Glance 2013", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264201453-en", "title": "Aid for Trade in Action", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1002/jid.1796", "title": "More Actors, More Money, More Ideas for International Development Co-operation", "journal": "Journal of International Development", "publisher": "Wiley"}], "policy": [{"overton_id": "ceprorg-6e8a3f7c50ef1f9df91fe4830f0b7d1c", "title": "Aid for Trade: What Have We Learnt?

In doing so, general trends, best practices and policy experiences are extracted to evaluate the current state of knowledge. The literature indicates that a high level of human capital is no doubt one of the key ingredients for attracting FDI, as well as for host countries to gain maximum benefits from their activities. Most developing countries, however, underinvest in human capital, and the investment that is actually taking place is unevenly distributed across countries and regions that have adopted different human resource development (HRD) policies.

OECD countries are thus confronted with the dual challenge of ensuring that the growth of new industries and activities is not stifled by labour bottlenecks and skill mismatches and that their population is equipped to master the basic IT skills which these transformations require. Despite recent claims of a widespread IT worker shortage, this study argues that although there is indeed some evidence of tightness in labour markets for particular categories of IT workers, the main issue of concern for policy makers and firms should be the gap between the skills of current and future IT workers and those sought by firms.Both short- and long-term strategies can be implemented to

Drawing on novel OECD inter-country input-output tables in previous year\u2019s prices, it shows there was no general trend towards deglobalisation in the period up to 2020. The fragmentation of production remained at a historically high level in 2019 and close to the level of 2011, confirming a stabilisation of the depth of global economic integration. Different trends are observed across economies: in the European Union, the import intensity of production grew before the COVID-19 pandemic, while China increasingly relied on domestic inputs. To explain these trends, bilateral trade costs are estimated and their cumulative impact along value chains is then calculated; structural changes and higher uncertainty seem to be the main drivers of increasing cumulative trade costs for some GVCs.

It develops a framework for analysing sources of the difference in ETRs and adapts existing models to compare forward-looking ETRs for low-carbon and high-carbon electricity generation technologies, considering tax provisions for cost recovery in 36 countries. It finds that standard tax systems are technology neutral when investments are debt-financed because the deductibility of interest payments compensates for the fact that capital allowances are based on nominal (rather than real) capital costs. Under equity finance, ETRs are higher for investments in capital-cost-intensive technologies as the cost of equity finance is often not deductible. Since low-carbon electricity generation tends to be relatively capital-intensive, this result represents a form of unintentional misalignment of the corporate tax system w...", "published_on":

Ship finance is a broad term that involves corporate financial management of shipping companies and shipyards as well as new-building finance. Shipping companies need funds in order to refinance their debts, to sustain their working capital and to acquire vessels. Shipyards also need to finance their working capital before delivering orders and receiving full payments. There are two main sources of capital allowing shipping companies to finance their businesses; raising money through equity financing (sales of shares) or debt (loans and bonds). In the case of shipbuilding, debt financing includes using leasing schemes. Given the fact that the maritime industry is highly capital intensive, and with the 2008 Global Financial Crisis\u2019 depressing effects on global economy and international trade, its financing has become critical for the shipbuilding sector and shipping companies around the world.", "published_on": "2019-08-01", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/e0448fd0-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/36d64afe88de69ce84ae8a4243c5c6ec.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/36d64afe88de69ce84ae8a4243c5c6ec.png", "topics": ["Greece", "Industrial and Commercial Bank of China", "Investment", "Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008", "Private equity", "Offshore financial centre", "Security (finance)", "Money", "Nippon Yusen", "United States dollar", "K Line", "Interest", "Leaseback", "Lease", "Libor", "Initial public offering", "Capital market", "Loan", "Ship", "China", "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries", "Financial capital", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Export credit agency", "Shipbuilding", "China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation", "Belt and Road Initiative", "Credit", "Debt", "Securitization", "Stock", "Mitsui O.S.K.

This \"standby power\" provides remote control capability, network sensing, digital display and other features. Often, standby power is consumed simply because power supplies remain \"on\" while their appliances are switched \"off\". Standby power consumption is about 10 per cent of OECD residential energy use or the equivalent of a 60-watt light bulb operating continuously in each OECD household. Standby power consumption can be reduced by an average of 75 per cent with cost-effective design changes and technological improvements. Savings as high as 90 per cent can be achieved in many appliances without any reduction in services. Some products have already achieved very low standby power consumption at little or no cost. But standby power consumption is normally not high enough to command consumer attention. International collaboration is essential to reduce standby power consum...", "published_on": "2001-05-23", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264192751-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/25d668b54bb0a54af8d01c90da1dc62b.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/25d668b54bb0a54af8d01c90da1dc62b.png", "topics": ["Standby power", "Efficient energy use", "International Energy Agency", "Energy Star", "Ecolabel", "Standardization", "Power supply", "Tax", "Home appliance", "European Union energy label", "Personal computer", "Energy conservation", "Electric energy consumption", "Power supply unit (computer)", "Liquid-crystal display", "Kilowatt-hour", "Electricity", "Electrical engineering", "Technology", "Energy demand management", "Wind power", "Manufactured goods", "Voltage regulator", "Market (economics)", "Electric power", "Energy", "Photocopier", "Printer (computing)", "Emissions trading", "European Union", "Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning", "Consumption (economics)", "International Electrotechnical Commission", "World energy supply and consumption", "Procurement", "ASHRAE", "OECD", "Computer monitor", "Refrigerator", "Economy", "Computer network", "Manufacturing", "Retail", "Set-top box", "Policy", "Multi-function printer", "Electronics"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "science and technology>technology and engineering", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology", "science and technology", "science and technology>technology and engineering>electronics", "economy, business and finance>economy"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/9789264192751-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1016/s0360-5442(99)00069-9", "title": "Power measurements and national energy consumption of televisions and videocassette recorders in the USA", "journal": "Energy", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}], "policy": [{"overton_id": "epagov-82e86fa623d449ae8ecffab467c3e2cc", "title": "United States Environmental Protection ' Agency Region-4", "policy_source_id": "epagov"}], "news": [], "people": [{"person": "Karen Rosen", "affiliation": "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "snippet": "This report draws on work by the task forces.

The evidence suggests that, while climate policies are likely to have a modest impact on aggregate employment, workers in certain regions and industries can be more severely affected. The transition may also have gender-differentiated impacts: men represent the largest share of the workforce of most negatively affected industries (e.g. coal-mining) while the growth of the renewable power generation sector, which exhibits a relatively more gender-balanced workforce, suggests that female employment may increase in the traditionally male-dominated energy sector. Lessons from the case-studies underline that a suite of polices is necessary to manage the structural adjustment process, including structural reforms and skills policies.

The report consists of three chapters. The first chapter depicts and benchmarks demographic trends in Korea regions against other regions from OECD countries.

It demonstrates that among small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), young firms play a central role in creating jobs, whereas old SMEs tend to destroy jobs. This pattern holds robustly across 17 OECD countries and Brazil, extending recent evidence found in the United States. The paper also shows that young firms are always net job creators throughout the business cycle, even during the financial crisis. During the crisis, entry and post-entry growth by young firms were affected most heavily, although downsizing by old firms was responsible for most job losses. The results also highlight large cross-country differences in the growth potential of young firms, pointing to the role played by national policies in enabling succes...", "published_on":

Despite the low content of about 0.1-0.2% of minor actinides in spent fuel, these actinides can nonetheless contribute significantly to decay heat loading and neutron output, as well as to the overall radiotoxic hazard of spent fuel. For this reason, there has long been an interest in transmuting minor actinides to reduce their impact on the back end of the fuel cycle. Fast reactors are needed to effectively transmute transuranics (TRUs), including minor actinides. However, recent studies have demonstrated that TRU transmutation rates can also be achieved in thermal reactors, although with certain limitations due to the accumulation of transuranics through recycling and their impact on the safety of power plants. The transmutation of TRUs could potentially be implemented in a substantial number of thermal reactors operating today, while waiting for a simila...", "published_on": "2014-01-07", "added_on":

However, the expansion has peaked and global uncertainties weigh on the outlook. Growth is projected to continue at a moderate rate, supported by expansionary monetary policies and fiscal measures to offset the 2019 consumption tax rate hike. Notwithstanding rising female participation, labour shortages are intensifying, reflecting Japan\u2019s shrinking and ageing population, thus underlining the importance of labour market reform. Traditional labour practices, such as seniority-based wages and mandatory retirement, are poorly suited to the era of 100-year lives. Comprehensive reforms, including abolishing the right of firms to set mandatory retirement and removing obstacles to female employment, are essential. Population ageing also puts further upward pressure on public social spending and government debt, which relative to GDP is already the highest ever recorded...", "published_on": "2019-04-15", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/fd63f374-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/fae11362e691df4e9e557a85edf97ea3.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/fae11362e691df4e9e557a85edf97ea3.png", "topics": ["Economy", "Economics", "Gender pay gap", "Bank", "Consumption (economics)", "Personal income", "Welfare", "Deflation", "Retirement", "Governance", "Interest rate", "Japan", "Pension", "Interest", "Macroeconomics", "Bribery", "Fiscal sustainability", "Quantitative easing", "Sustainability", "Labour economics", "Small and medium-sized enterprises", "Corporate governance", "Monetary policy", "Bank of Japan", "Employment", "Gross domestic product", "Productivity", "Abenomics", "Government spending", "Tax", "Government budget balance", "Inflation", "Economic growth", "Fiscal policy", "Finance", "Yield curve", "OECD", "Government debt", "Japanese asset price bubble", "Income", "Air pollution", "Poverty", "Money", "SME finance", "Investor", "Loan", "Unemployment", "Japanese yen", "Price", "Business", "Baseline (budgeting)", "Fiscal year", "Infrastructure", "Health care", "Child care", "Whistleblower", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Central bank", "Government bond", "Economic inequality", "Long-term care", "Consumer price index", "Health", "Economic bubble", "Indexation", "Investment", "Bond (finance)"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>financial and business service", "economy, business and finance>economy", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics>inflation", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>financial and business service>personal income", "science and technology"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/fd63f374-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1787/9789264302402-en", "title": "Education Policy in Japan", "journal": "Reviews of National Policies for Education", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264304468-en", "title": "Tax Policy Reforms 2018", "journal": "Tax Policy Reforms", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264279391-en", "title": "2013 OECD Recommendation of the Council on Gender Equality in Education, Employment and Entrepreneurship", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264289642-en", "title": "Labor Migration in Asia: Increasing the Development Impact of Migration through Finance and Technology", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/d1b2b844-en", "title": "The Rising Cost of Ambient Air Pollution thus Far in the 21st Century", "journal": "OECD Environment Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/pension_glance-2017-en", "title": "Pensions at a Glance 2017", "journal": "OECD Pensions at a Glance", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/888933953563", "title": "Figure 22.

Economies not only benefit from inward flows of goods, services, people, capital and knowledge, but also from outward flows of those factors of production. But economic openness does not necessarily yield automatic benefits, and governments may need to complement policies to open the economy with policies that help individuals and firms adjust to liberalisation and ensure that aggregate benefits for the domestic economy are optimised.

Following the literature, technology transfer-related policies are grouped into six categories: 1) absorptive capacity policies; 2) measures related to intellectual property rights (IPR); 3) FDI promotion measures; 4) FDI restrictions and FDI screening; 5) performance requirements; and 6) investment incentives. A list of regulatory questions about measures in place is devised for the four categories 3 through 6 on which information is currently particularly scarce.

The next three challenges refer to the \u201cenabling\u201d conditions that strengthen the overall skills system. Success in tackling these skills challenges will boost performance across the whole skills system. All of the challenges identified are strongly interlinked, and their connections with each other are identified throughout the report at the end of each challenge.

This report describes how Brazil\u2019s 33 courts of accounts can use their oversight function \u2013 including audits \u2013 to help make such decentralised policies more effective and coherent. It presents the results of a 3-year project to improve how the courts can work together, using the area of education as a pilot for testing the use of indicators in the strategic selection of audits. The report offers a model for audit institutions to assess multi-level governance, and explores governance models for stronger collaboration among the courts of accounts in Brazil. These approaches may inspire and inform other supreme audit institutions with responsibilities for auditing decentralised policies and programmes involving central, regional and local governments.", "published_on": "2020-11-26", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/30023307-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/db4dff11bb4912d3bffec0ac5a6d69c3.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/db4dff11bb4912d3bffec0ac5a6d69c3.png", "topics": ["Teacher", "International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions", "Policy", "Quantitative research", "Fault tree analysis", "Internal audit", "Risk assessment", "Multi-level governance", "Risk management", "Decentralization", "Logic model", "Education", "Audit", "Scenario planning", "Governance", "Risk", "Accountability", "Auditor's report", "System", "Cognition", "Education policy", "Branches of science", "Evaluation", "Programme for International Student Assessment", "Politics", "OECD", "Analysis", "Conceptual model"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "education", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economy"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/30023307-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1787/ac8ed8e8-en", "title": "OECD Public Integrity Handbook", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.18235/0001853", "title": "Novo Fundeb: Pr\u00f3s e contras das propostas em debate", "publisher": "Inter-American Development Bank"}, {"doi": "10.1111/j.1468-0386.2007.00378.x", "title": "Analysing and Assessing Accountability: A Conceptual Framework", "journal": "European Law Journal", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1111/j.1467-9299.2009.01775.x", "title": "TOWARDS AN EXOGENOUS THEORY OF PUBLIC NETWORK PERFORMANCE", "journal": "Public Administration", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.4000/echogeo.15060", "title": "Regional Inequalities in Brazil: Divergent Readings on Their Origin and Public Policy Design", "journal": "EchoG\u00e9o", "publisher": "OpenEdition"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264301603-en", "title": "Effective Teacher Policies", "journal": "PISA", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264263871-en", "title": "Supreme Audit Institutions and Good Governance", "journal": "Towards Efficient Public Procurement in Colombia", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264293014-en", "title": "Rethinking Regional Development Policy-making", "journal": "Investing Together", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264123229-en", "title": "OECD Territorial Reviews: Brazil 2013", "journal": "OECD Territorial Reviews", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/5k49j2cjv5mq-en", "title": "Creating Conditions for Effective Public Investment", "journal": "OECD Regional Development Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/g2g9faa7-en", "title": "Making Decentralisation Work", "journal": "Investing Together", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264226159-en", "title": "Skills for Social Progress", "journal": "OECD Skills Studies", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/f0944eae-en", "title": "Assigning responsibilities across levels of government", "journal": "OECD Working Papers on Fiscal Federalism", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264192294-en", "title": "OECD Reviews of Risk Management Policies: Mexico 2013", "journal": "Illicit Trade", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/5jm5cgr8j532-en", "title": "Using Outcome Indicators to Improve Policies", "journal": "OECD Regional Development Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.5751/es-03798-150429", "title": "Disentangling Scale Approaches in Governance Research: Comparing Monocentric, Multilevel, and Adaptive Governance", "journal": "Ecology and Society", "publisher": "Resilience Alliance, Inc."}, {"doi": "10.1787/f8d7880d-en", "title": "Education at a Glance 2019", "journal": "Education at a Glance", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/dd49116c-en", "title": "Making decentralisation work: A handbook for policy-makers", "journal": "Investing Together", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1257/pol.20150249", "title": "Does Money Matter in the Long Run?

The agro-food sector also needs to absorb exchange-rate and cost pressures created by the mining boom.

This report provides an overview of the use of telemedicine in OECD countries, describing how governments scaled up remote care during the pandemic and exploring the impact that this massive shift to remote care has had on health care system performance. Telemedicine may be here to stay, but questions remain concerning how to regulate its use, how to pay for it, how to integrate it with in-person care, and how to make sure that it constitutes good value for money for all.

The key features in this vision are flexible and networked institutions and local strategies emphasising entrepreneurship, human capital and social cohesion.Based on the proceedings of the OECD-Scottish Enterprise Glasgow conference, this publication examines how city and region governments and development agencies need to use their devolved powers to respond to globalisation. Trends and challenges are discussed and examples drawn from across the OECD. They address how cities and regions can develop strategies to assure their competitiveness in the globalising economy and how they can help counteract the negative effects of globalisation on marginalised people and places.Devolution is more than just a transfer of power, it is also a new spirit of co-operation and networking between different levels of government and their civil society partners.

It has been one of the fastest growing economic zones in East Asia since China\u2019s opening in the early 1990s,\u00a0thanks to\u00a0the region\u2019s extensive manufacturing and transportation networks. Development has been\u00a0driven by cities such as Dalian, Qingdao and Tianjin in China, Busan and Incheon in Korea, and Fukuoka and Kitakyushu in Japan. However, the PYSR has yet not fully utilised its assets nor reached its potential for growth. Further economic integration has been hindered by excessive competition and inadequate co-operation within the region.

Its economy is changing from one driven by labour-intensive activities to one based on knowledge industries, while traditional and labour-intensive sectors (e.g. textiles and its supply chain) are shifting only gradually and slowly to other complementary industry segments.

But with rising mobility and demographic change, it is no longer so simple to invest in a skilled workforce for the future. Actions are needed on a variety of fronts, including attracting and retaining talent, better integrating disadvantaged groups into the labour force, and upgrading the skills of low-paid workers. Much of the responsibility for these actions falls squarely on the shoulders of local policy makers. Drawing from a wide array of case studies, this\u00a0book analyses best-practice local strategies for increasing workforce skills.

It is thus important to understand the costs of decommissioning so as to develop coherent and cost-effective strategies, realistic cost estimates based on decommissioning plans from the outset of operations and mechanisms to ensure that future decommissioning expenses can be adequately covered.\nThis study presents the results of an NEA review of the costs of decommissioning nuclear power plants and of overall funding practices adopted across NEA member countries. The study is based on the results of this NEA questionnaire, on actual decommissioning costs or estimates, and on plans for the establishment and management of decommissioning funds.

Research on the overall costs of electricity is an ongoing effort, as only certain costs of electricity provision are perceived directly by producers and consumers. Other costs, such as the health impacts of air pollution, damage from climate change or the effects on the electricity system of small-scale variable production are not reflected in market prices and thus diminish well-being in unaccounted for ways.Accounting for these social costs in order to establish the full costs of electricity provision is difficult, yet such costs are too important to be disregarded in the context of the energy transitions currently under way in OECD and NEA countries.

However, its mining regions, including Antofagasta, face the challenge of developing a critically important primary sector in a manner that contributes to both economic growth and broader measures of well-being. Antofagasta's long term sustainability goals include a more diversified economic base, supported by a city that is lived in for its high quality of life and the opportunities it offers. To achive this, it will need to make the most of its natural endowments, improve the city's physical attractiveness and ensure better urban policy outcomes. It will also require regional and local actors to act in a strategic and innovative manner. This study focuses on economic diversification, urbanism and governance in the city of Antofagasta.

A number of OECD governments have established programmes to try to stimulate the development of business-to-business services.

As regards stimulating demand for general business-to-business services, there is little that governments can do directly, other than supporting industry initiatives. The United Kingdom has recognised this with its UK Trade project, which is intended to become a comprehensive electronic market-place, where a range of goods and services can be offered and transactions completed. The aim is to have 250 000 companies participating within five years; the project itself is run by the company ICL, with a \u00a3450 000 grant from the UK Department of Trade and Industry and information from trade associations (Financial Times, 1997e).", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "579.

Will it be\u00a0under-invested, vulnerable and dirty, or\u00a0clean, clever and competitive? This edition of WEO responds to the remit of the G8 world leaders by mapping a new energy future, contrasting it with where we are now headed. WEO 2006 shows how to change course. It counts the costs and benefits - and the benefits win.World Energy Outlook 2006 also answers these questions: Is the economic reaction to high energy prices merely delayed?Is oil and gas investment on track?Are the conditions shaping up for a nuclear energy revival?Can biofuels erode the oil monopoly in road transport?Can 2.5 billion people in developing countries switch to modern energy for cooking?Is Brazil learning new lessons or teaching the world?With extensive statistics, detailed projections, analysis and advice, WEO 2006 equips policy-makers and the public to re-make the energy

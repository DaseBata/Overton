The Commission concluded that in terms of ability, EBS\u2019s market share upstream ([0-10]%) would seem to be too limited to award it sufficient market power to foreclose rivals downstream. In possible narrower separate markets upstream (electronic anonymous FX trading services), EBS may have a greater market share. However, in terms of incentives, with MarkitSERV\u2019s market share in FX CCP connectivity downstream being [90-100]%, there is limited market share to gain through foreclosure of upstream FX trade flows from EBS. Moreover, CME as a parent of the JV would have limited incentives to foreclose rivals of the JV downstream, as CME would only receive 50% of the benefit of any increase in revenues downstream via stake in the JV, while bearing 100% of the losses in its FX trading venue upstream (as well as facing all of the risk of reputational damage from such a strategy). In terms of impact, both competitors downstream (Bloomberg and State Street) are vertically integrated with FX trading venues upstream which both have likely significantly higher market shares than EBS. If EBS were to foreclose its trade flow to those rival FX CCP connectivity providers, this would be more likely to harm EBS\u2019s position in FX trading markets. Customers prefer to \u201cshop around\u201d and trade on multiple venues, so if a venue tried to create a vertical silo and reduce access, FX traders would likely (all else being equal) find that venues\u2019 offering less attractive. FX trading venue competitors responding to the market investigation rate the impact of the Transaction as mixed, with 50% expecting a negative impact (replies to question 17 of Questionnaire 5). However, given the limited ability and incentives to engage in exclusionary conduct, the Commission concludes that the Transaction is unlikely to give rise to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market as a result of non-horizontal effects in the markets for FX CCP connectivity services and OTC FX trading services in terms of input foreclosure.", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "(332) Downstream, as outlined in Section 5.3 above, MarkitSERV is the leading provider of CCP connectivity worldwide in the FX ([90-100]% market share) asset class. 330 MarkitSERV faces competition from trading venues, which provide customers with the ability to send trades directly to CCPs (without the intermediation of any middleware provider, such as MarkitSERV).

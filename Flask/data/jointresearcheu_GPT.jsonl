An analysis of RIS3 indicators suggests that a proper \u2018priority taxonomy\u2019 is lacking, raising doubts whether countries and regions are truly selective in setting priorities, whether they align the priority setting process between the national and regional level and whether the resulting set of priorities is really a factor of differentiation for countries and re...", "published_on": "2021-09-22", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC125959", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC125959/keltchermans_et_al.-report_s3_implementation2021_16.09.2021_final_1.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/bdf2f229a19ce1b1b28f75b61516712a.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/bdf2f229a19ce1b1b28f75b61516712a.png", "topics": ["Branches of science", "Science", "GUID Partition Table", "Data analysis", "Strategy", "European Union", "Evaluation", "Policy", "Research", "Innovation", "Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development", "Governance", "European Structural and Investment Funds", "Economics", "Education", "Top-down and bottom-up design", "Monitoring and evaluation", "Correlation", "Entrepreneurship", "Technology", "Multi-level governance", "Research and development", "Cognition", "European Commission", "Information", "Non-governmental organization", "Communication", "Data", "Technology roadmap", "Database", "Bibliometrics", "Goal", "Government procurement", "Evidence"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["education>school", "economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>business information", "economy, business and finance>business information>strategy and marketing", "education", "science and technology", "education>school>further education", "economy, business and finance>business information>strategy and marketing>research and development"], "source_tags": ["Innovation and growth"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/711198", "9789276403180", "JRC125959", "OP KJ-09-21-288-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2760/073148", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2776/617294", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2307/2601030", "title": "The Effects of Government-Industry R&D Programs on Private R&D: The Case of the Small Business Innovation Research Program", "journal": "The RAND Journal of Economics", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1257/0002828041301407", "title": "Was Electricity a General Purpose Technology?

Within the growth-accounting methodology, in Sect. 3, we discuss the U.S. - E.U. productivity gap and the role of ICTs, and we show that the latter are responsible for the U.S. acceleration in productivity growth observed in the period 1996-2006 and for the widening of the U.S. \u2013 E.U. productivity gap in the same period.

The current report presents an original and comprehensive methodology to estimate AI investments. It rests on three assumptions: First, it considers AI as a general-purpose technology (GPT). Second, it includes not only investments in the core AI technology, but in complementary assets and capabilities necessary for its adoption. Finally, the methodology recognises different roles that the public and private sectors play in the process of AI creation and implementation.

Its rationale involves both the fact that, even in the information age, the logic of specialisation is intact, particularly for small entities such as regional economies in Europe and the argument that the task of identification (of what should be prioritised) is very difficult and therefore needs a sophisticated policy design. Smart specialisation is not a planning doctrine that requires a region to specialise in a particular set of industries. Instead, it seeks robust and transparent means for nominating those new activities, at regional level, that aim at exploring and discovering new technological and market opportunities and at opening thereby new domains for constructing regional competitive advantages. Thus, rather than offering a method for determining if a hypothetical region has a \u201cstrength\u201d in a particular set of activities, e.g., tourism and fisheries, the crucial question is whether that region would benefit from and should specialise in certain R&D and innovation projects in some lead activities such as tourism or fisheries. With this policy brief, it is our aim to set out a coherent vision of the goals of the policy approach that is evoked by the term smart specialisation.

Between 1995 and 2010, the ICT sectors have accounted for over 20% of EU15 growth, even though they only constitute 5% of EU15 GDP. The high growth resulting from the ever-increasing pace of ICT-related innovation requires high levels of R&D to be sustained. Indeed, the European ICT sector accounts for over a quarter of overall business expenditure on R&D, which makes it the largest R&D investing sector.A set of EU policy initiatives emphasise the importance of ICT and the underlying R&D for boosting European performance and competiveness. In order to ensure that public policies create the right conditions for sustaining and increasing the support for R&D, an appropriate measuring framework based on the thorough review of the best available methodologies need to be devised.

We focus on regional innovation systems and globalisation in order to propose an organizing framework for the analysis of the impact of ICT diffusion on regional development.", "published_on": "2010-08-26", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC59920", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC59920/jrc59920.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/f526f73d0471199c9eb9591a832f55dc.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/f526f73d0471199c9eb9591a832f55dc.png", "topics": ["Human activities", "Business", "Entrepreneurship", "Research", "Capital (economics)", "Human capital", "World Wide Web", "Economy", "Knowledge economy", "Internet", "Infrastructure", "Labour economics", "Economics", "Information and communications technology", "Market (economics)", "Offshoring", "Outsourcing", "Diffusion of innovations", "Globalization", "Production (economics)", "Innovation", "Productivity", "Economic growth", "Business economics", "Gross domestic product", "Information technology", "Competition (economics)", "Competition", "Information", "Knowledge spillover", "System", "Venture capital", "Economies of scale", "Economic geography", "Technology", "Institution", "Investment", "European Union", "Technological change", "Emergence", "Employment", "Web 2.0", "International trade", "Research and development", "Regional innovation system", "Social capital", "Market access", "Economies of agglomeration"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics>economic indicator", "economy, business and finance>economy", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology", "science and technology", "education", "society", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics>economic indicator>productivity"], "source_tags": ["Information society", "Innovation and growth"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2791/46419", "9789279165689", "JRC59920", "EUR 24510 EN", "OP LF-NA-24510-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1111/1475-4991.00036", "title": "MEASURING THE NEW ECONOMY: AN INTERNATIONAL COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE", "journal": "Review of Income and Wealth", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1353/eca.2002.0003", "title": "Intangible Assets: Computers and Organizational Capital", "journal": "Brookings Papers on Economic Activity", "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press"}, {"doi": "10.2307/2534534", "title": "The Productivity Slowdown, Measurement Issues, and the Explosion of Computer Power", "journal": "Brookings Papers on Economic Activity", "publisher": "JSTOR"}, {"doi": "10.2307/2534658", "title": "Computers and Output Growth Revisited: How Big is the Puzzle?", "journal": "Brookings Papers on Economic Activity", "publisher": "JSTOR"}, {"doi": "10.2307/2118401", "title": "Geographic Localization of Knowledge Spillovers as Evidenced by Patent Citations", "journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}, {"doi": "10.1016/s0014-2921(98)00047-6", "title": "Innovation in cities:", "journal": "European Economic Review", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.3386/w12721", "title": "Trading Tasks: A Simple Theory of Offshoring", "publisher": "National Bureau of Economic Research"}, {"doi": "10.1920/wp.ifs.2005.0522", "title": "Outsourcing and offshoring of business services: how important is ICT?", "journal": "Working Paper Series", "publisher": "Institute for Fiscal Studies"}, {"doi": "10.2307/3503346", "title": "Structural Change and Technology: A Long View", "journal": "Revue \u00e9conomique", "publisher": "JSTOR"}, {"doi": "10.1016/s0308-5961(01)00052-0", "title": "Information\u2013communications technologies (ICT) and transport: does knowledge underpin policy?", "journal": "Telecommunications Policy", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00064-6", "title": "ICT clusters in Europe The great central banana and the small Nordic potato", "journal": "Information Economics and Policy", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1191/0309132504ph469oa", "title": "Clusters and knowledge: local buzz, global pipelines and the process of knowledge creation", "journal": "Progress in Human Geography", "publisher": "SAGE Publications"}, {"doi": "10.1504/ijeim.2007.012888", "title": "Knowledge links in high-technology industries: markets, networks or milieu?

In order to assess the growth potential of this new wave of innovation, we study the impact of AI technologies on total factor productivity, TFP, We analyse improvements in productivity that originate from firms that have patented AI technologies, In particular, we exploit a novel data set on AI patents at the firm level to analyze whether the extent with which firms develop AI technologies positively affects productivity and wages.

However, we lack the tools to determine which achievements will be attained in the near future. Also, we usually underestimate which various technologies in AI are capable of today. This report constitutes the second edition of a study proposing an example-based methodology to categorise and assess several AI technologies, by mapping them onto Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) (e.g., maturity and availability levels). We first interpret the nine TRLs in the context of AI and identify different categories in AI to which they can be assigned. We then introduce new bidimensional plots, called readiness-vs-generality charts, where we see that higher TRLs are achievable for low-generality technologies focusing on narrow or specific abilities, while high TRLs are still out of reach for more general capabilities.

Special attention is paid within a gravity model framework to the impact of service trade restrictions on both margins of retail trade internationalisation. The use of hurdle models for count data to estimate the determinants of the extensive margin takes into account that there are a lot of zero counts for the number of retail trade firms controlled by a country j in an EU country i.

In that year a multi-level framework was designed that included a national and seven regional Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3). The role of regions in research and innovation policy was much less advanced in Portugal than other (Western) European countries, but a logical step to implement a concept that gives local actors a prominent role in strategy development through a process of entrepreneurial discovery. Smart Specialisation is a difficult concept to implement successfully because it crosses policy responsibilities and geographical levels. This report finds that a number of problems in the governance of S3 implementation accentuated these difficulties in Portugal: a governance structure that was never really activated; a policy mix constrained by the legal framework governing R&I spending by the European Structural and Investment Funds, preventing a flexible place based approach th...", "published_on": "2020-08-04", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC121189", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC121189/s3_implementation_in_portugal_v2.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/2b04f3e1a49311f3a8baef8828987f03.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/2b04f3e1a49311f3a8baef8828987f03.png", "topics": ["Cognition", "Branches of science", "Data", "Council of the European Union", "Science", "Economy", "System", "Knowledge economy", "Information", "European Union", "Economic growth", "Startup company", "Research and development", "Decentralization", "Strategy", "Technology", "Education", "Strategic management", "Research", "Technology roadmap", "Portugal", "Multi-level governance", "Policy", "Entrepreneurship", "Evaluation", "Innovation", "Governance", "Public participation (decision making)", "Decision-making", "Forestry", "Design", "SWOT analysis", "Creativity", "Implementation", "Standardization", "Monitoring and evaluation", "Sustainability", "Tourism", "Business", "Non-governmental organization", "Infrastructure", "European Structural and Investment Funds", "Thought", "Goal", "Cognitive science", "Business model", "Qualitative research", "Human capital", "Fourth Industrial Revolution", "Food industry", "Venture capital", "Top-down and bottom-up design", "University", "Market (economics)", "Health", "Focus group", "Sea", "Participatory design", "Technology transfer", "Information and communications technology", "Organization", "Design thinking", "Knowledge", "Creative industries", "Employment"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "politics", "economy, business and finance>economy", "science and technology", "science and technology>social sciences", "politics>government", "education"], "source_tags": ["Innovation and growth"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/903016", "9789276210474", "JRC121189", "EUR 30287 EN", "OP KJ-1A-30287-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2307/2555502", "title": "A Penny for Your Quotes: Patent Citations and the Value of Innovations", "journal": "The RAND Journal of Economics", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1080/00343400701565846", "title": "Governance, Science Policy and Regions: An Introduction", "journal": "Regional Studies", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1787/eco_surveys-prt-2019-en", "title": "OECD Economic Surveys: Portugal 2019", "journal": "OECD Economic Surveys: Portugal 2012", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264308138-en", "title": "OECD Review of Higher Education, Research and Innovation: Portugal", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.3152/147154303781780290", "title": "Principal-agent theory and research policy: an introduction", "journal": "Science and Public Policy", "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}, {"doi": "10.1017/s0143814x00000994", "title": "Who Governs Intermediary Agencies?

It is a complex system in itself, consisting of an ever-changing infrastructure used by a large number of actors of very different sizes. The boundaries of the power system are characterised by ever-evolving interfaces with equally complex subsystems such as gas transport and distribution, heating and cooling, and, increasingly, transport. The situation is further complicated by the fact that electricity is only a carrier, able to fulfil demand for such things as lighting, heat or mobility.One specific and fundamental feature of the electricity system is that demand and generation must match at any time, while satisfying technical and economic constraints.

However, the main unanswered questions about this foreseen transformation are when and how this is going to happen. Not only do we lack the tools to determine what achievements will be attained in the near future, but we even underestimate what various technologies in AI are capable of today. Many so-called breakthroughs in AI are simply associated with highly-cited research papers or good performance on some particular benchmarks. Certainly, the translation from papers and benchmark performance to products is faster in AI than in other non-digital sectors. However, it is still the case that research breakthroughs do not directly translate to a technology that is ready to use in real-world environments.

Since computational methods cover a broad range of models and tools, emphasis was placed on Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) and Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models, and their potential role in predicting NM properties. In addition, the status of a diverse array of compartment-based mathematical models was assessed. These models comprised toxicokinetic (TK), toxicodynamic (TD), in vitro and in vivo dosimetry, and environmental fate models. Finally, based on systematic reviews of the scientific literature, as well as the outputs of the EU-funded research projects, recommendations for further research and development w...", "published_on": "2017-07-07", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC106386", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC106386/kjna28617enn.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/5b2df1dfbd9b1c0cb6d299ab12d463ce.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/5b2df1dfbd9b1c0cb6d299ab12d463ce.png", "topics": ["Physical sciences", "DLVO theory", "Quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship", "Particle aggregation", "Endocytosis", "Titanium dioxide", "Chemistry", "Applied and interdisciplinary physics", "Physical chemistry", "Van der Waals force", "Phagocytosis", "Genotoxicity", "Brownian motion", "Dispersion (chemistry)", "Colloid", "Double layer (surface science)", "Flocculation", "Redox", "Biocide", "Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals", "Radical (chemistry)", "Cell membrane", "Lung", "Diffusion", "Nanomaterials", "Nanotechnology", "Risk", "Novel food", "Cosmetics", "Oxidative stress", "Exposure assessment", "Pinocytosis"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["science and technology>natural science>physics", "science and technology>natural science", "economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "science and technology>natural science>physics>nuclear physics", "science and technology>natural science>chemistry", "science and technology>natural science>biology", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>chemicals", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>chemicals>inorganic chemical", "science and technology>natural science>physics>nuclear physics>particle physics", "science and technology", "science and technology>natural science>biology>physiology"], "source_tags": ["Health and consumer protection"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/248139", "10.2760/911484", "9789279687082", "9789279687099", "JRC106386", "EUR 28617 EN", "OP KJ-NA-28617-EN-C", "OP KJ-NA-28617-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1007/s10953-013-0062-2", "title": "New LSER Model Based on Solvent Empirical Parameters for the Prediction and Description of the Solubility of Buckminsterfullerene in Various Solvents", "journal": "Journal of Solution Chemistry", "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC"}, {"doi": "10.1093/toxsci/28.1.41", "title": "A Multiple-Path Model of Particle Deposition in the Rat Lung", "journal": "Toxicological Sciences", "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.10.067", "title": "Quasi-QSAR for mutagenic potential of multi-walled carbon-nanotubes", "journal": "Chemosphere", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.09.089", "title": "Optimal descriptor as a translator of eclectic information into the prediction of membrane damage by means of various TiO2 nanoparticles", "journal": "Chemosphere", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1080/1062936x.2013.840679", "title": "Evaluation criteria for the quality of published experimental data on nanomaterials and their usefulness for QSAR modelling", "journal": "SAR and QSAR in Environmental Research", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1080/10807039.2011.538639", "title": "Challenges in Exposure Modeling of Nanoparticles in Aquatic Environments", "journal": "Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1897/08-090.1", "title": "NANOMATERIALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT: BEHAVIOR, FATE, BIOAVAILABILITY, AND EFFECTS", "journal": "Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1186/1743-8977-11-9", "title": "ITS-NANO -

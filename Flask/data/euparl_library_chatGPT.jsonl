These systems improve the privacy and security of communications by using cryptography through an algorithm that transforms standard text characters into an unreadable format, securing communications from one endpoint to another. This explains the general trend in recent years for online community forums, chat rooms and messaging apps to E2E-encrypt their participants/members' communication exchanges. Thus business documents, financial details, legal proceedings and/or personal conversations including photos, videos or livestreamed material can be protected more effectively. However, E2EE alone does not guarantee privacy or security, as data may be held unencrypted on the user's own device, or be accessible if the login is compromised. Other uses of E2EE, in addition to securing communication, include better protection of passwords and data storage. E2EE also supports internet freedom and democracy as it makes censorship and surveillance harder. As countries implement legislation to prevent not only illegal but also other harmful content online, digital platforms might see E2EE as a solution, as companies cannot moderate encrypted online content and be liable for it if they cannot technically access it. Some see this as one of the reasons why social media platforms want to promote E2EE, in addition to improving their users' privacy. Conversely, industry representatives and civil society groups expressed concern that to avoid E2EE, social media platforms could take steps that create unacceptable, negative impacts on users' privacy as a way to provide proactive moderation of private online spaces while scanning and assessing the content of conversations. Another related issue is the definition of what constitutes a 'private communication' today. Traditionally, private communication included mainly one-to-one phone calls or messages. Today, digital platforms enable many participants to take part in an online videoconference or in chat groups, sometimes with thousands of users (WhatsApp communities for instance allow for up to 2000 users). Meanwhile, E2EE is not immune to cyber-attacks. Although E2EE can secure data against them more effectively, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), and some experts believe that the developments in quantum technology will further expose its security vulnerabilities to crack E2EE. https://www.wired.com/2016/04/forget-apple-vs-fbi-whatsapp-just-switched-encryption-billion-people/https://www.ibm.com/topics/end-to-end-encryptionhttps://losspreventionmedia.com/end-to-end-encryption-doesnt-guarantee-internet-privacy/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66099040https://petsymposium.org/popets/2023/popets-2023-0060.pdf https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2020)659360 https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/-/news/social-media-discussion-paper-published https://nas.io/blog/setup-whatsapp-communities https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08839514.2022.2037254 https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/quantum-computing-algorithms-encryption-vulnerabilities https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-quantum-computers-about-to-break-online-privacy/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.wired.com/2016/04/forget-apple-vs-fbi-whatsapp-just-switched-encryption-billion-people/https://www.ibm.com/topics/end-to-end-encryptionhttps://losspreventionmedia.com/end-to-end-encryption-doesnt-guarantee-internet-privacy/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66099040https://petsymposium.org/popets/2023/popets-2023-0060.pdf", "matched_news_outlet": "Wired Magazine"}, {"reference_string": "Children are increasingly using the internet.

It asks whether a rising sense of unfairness may be fuelling it. It defines and measures fairness in a multi-dimensional context and spells out what data can tell us about fairness in Europe today.The report is divided into three sections:First, it examines long and short-term trends in income inequality. It considers whether digitisation and the rise of the collaborative economy could be potential drivers of market income inequalities. It also examines the redistributive impact of direct tax and social benefit systems in Europe. Second, it assesses how family background and geographical location affect labour market outcomes, education and health. The addition of the spatial dimension is an important novelty. Working solely with national averages is dangerous because it risks missing major disparities within countries.

An in-depth analysis of these new technologies is presented in this work.Many of the technologies demonstrating high potential in reducing CO2 and market uptake in the near future (e.g. aero devices for trailers and bodies and hybrid electric powertrains) are currently being implemented in VECTO. The next steps can include zero-emission vehicles, such as fuel cell vehicles, and technologies that could be easily implemented.", "published_on": "2021-04-01", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC124655", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC124655/jrc124655_report_vecto_final_%281%29.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/92c2a0379117d46aae5c78390b35f775.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/92c2a0379117d46aae5c78390b35f775.png", "topics": ["Mechanical engineering", "Vehicle technology", "Manufactured goods", "Transportation engineering", "Technology", "Transport", "Energy", "Vehicles", "Waste heat", "Rolling resistance", "Dual-clutch transmission", "Propulsion transmission", "Engine", "Hybrid vehicle drivetrain", "Hybrid electric vehicle", "Energy-efficient driving", "Tire", "Internal combustion engine", "Electric vehicle", "Truck", "Hybrid vehicle", "Vehicle", "Compressor", "Drivetrain", "Axle", "Cruise control", "Exhaust gas", "Advanced driver-assistance system", "Fuel cell", "Fuel economy in automobiles", "Plug-in hybrid", "Continuously variable transmission", "Battery electric vehicle", "Tire-pressure monitoring system", "Trailer (vehicle)", "Pump", "Combustion", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Fuel", "Fuel efficiency", "Hydrogen fuel", "Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning", "Steering", "Mild hybrid", "Wheel", "Fuel cell vehicle", "Hydraulic hybrid vehicle", "Self-driving car", "Variable displacement", "Electricity", "Air pollution", "Speed limiter", "Heat recovery ventilation", "European Union", "Simulation", "Carbon dioxide", "Power steering", "Aerodynamics", "Dynamometer", "Traffic", "Carbon neutrality", "Brake", "Energy management", "Motor vehicles", "Clutch", "Machines", "Vortex generator", "Redox", "Adaptive cruise control"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>transport>road transport", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>energy and resource", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>transport", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>energy and resource>diesel fuel"], "source_tags": ["Energy and transport", "Environment and climate change"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/985739", "9789276340249", "JRC124655", "EUR 30658 EN", "OP KJ-NA-30658-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2790/10868", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.energy.2016.02.076", "title": "An experimental evaluation of the methodology proposed for the monitoring and certification of CO2 emissions from heavy-duty vehicles in Europe", "journal": "Energy", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}], "policy": [{"overton_id": "jointresearcheu-aaf68e81ef47492b1f35bda0f9f6dbbf", "title": "Report on VECTO Technology Simulation Capabilities and Future Outlook", "policy_source_id": "jointresearcheu"}], "news": [], "people": [{"person": "Georgios Fontaras", "affiliation": "Joint Research Centre", "snippet": "Name: Georgios Fontaras\nAddress: European Commission, Joint Research centre (JRC), Via E.

Often countries themselves re-orientate their strategies and internationalisation of their S&T policies according to emerging competitiveness and economic challenges. Therefore, to obtain better insights into ERA countries' international S&T cooperation with these countries, a questionnaire based approach was developed through the CREST Working Group on Internationalisation of R&D , focused on ERA countries' policies on internationalisation of S&T. It was aimed at providing an overview of their S&T cooperation policies, their dynamics, government strategies and related experiences with BIR. The report thus aims to provide an assessment of the status of public S&T cooperation based on analysis of questionnaire responses and further analytical work to identify good practices, common objectives and open questions. These in turn feed more focused discussions and possible transnational coordination of certain internationalisation policies with these countries. The original questionnaire data has been summarised and used to produce some composite indicators, which served as a basis for an overall comparative assessment. 23 completed sets of questionnaires and an additional single questionnaire had been received covering 21 MS representing approximately 75% of MS and 3 AC representing 60% of the addressed countries.A new assessment and benchmark methodology was developed for a thorough analysis of the questionnaire responses based on the quantification of numerous qualitative responses. Two models describing corresponding composite quantitative indicators were introduced for comparison of intensity of ERA countries' governmental S&T cooperation with BIR. Model 1 - Index \"Degree of Networking\" based on policy instruments implemented for international S&T cooperation with BIR in ERA countries; and Model 2 - Index \"Cooperation Status\" a composite indicator summing up information on ERA countries' S&T cooperation policy dynamic, institutional capacity and related policy measures, and practical implementation of S&T cooperation policies with BIR, together describing the overall S&T cooperation policy implementation framework for S&T internationalisation with BIR. Since the two models and indexes supplement each other, calculated numeric values for ERA countries were combined and the composite quantitative indicator named \"Intensity of Cooperation\" was introduced for integrated assessment of ERA countries' international S&T cooperation. A composite indicator for the assessment of policy relevance was related with performance of S&T cooperation policies alone, as well as with GERD as a proxy indicator for hard Input and scientific co-publications as Output indicator. On this basis, ERA countries were benchmarked and further comparative assessment/analysis of expected practical impacts of introduced and planned policies on internationalisation of S&T cooperation in ERA countries with BIR, based on comparisons of questionnaire data with the additional information obtained via data mining was made. Comparisons with information obtained via the Thomson Reuters Scientific ISI Web of Knowledge - ISI Science Citation Index (Expanded), Eurostat and EC, DG RTD Regional Key Figures Databases supported assessment of underlying reasons for good S&T cooperation practices.

The 2\u00b0C target could be achieved by simultaneously transforming various elements of the energy system: shifting final energy demand from mainly fossil fuels towards electricity and low-carbon

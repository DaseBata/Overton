The network is composed of economists\nfrom the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), i.e. the 27 national central banks of the European Union (EU) and the European\nCentral Bank. The objective of MaRs is to develop core conceptual frameworks, models and/or tools supporting macro-prudential\nsupervision in the EU.\nThe research is carried out in three work streams: 1) Macro-financial models linking financial stability and the performance of the\neconomy; 2) Early warning systems and systemic risk indicators; 3) Assessing contagion risks.\nMaRs is chaired by Philipp Hartmann (ECB). Paolo Angelini (Banca d\u2019Italia), Laurent Clerc (Banque de France), Carsten Detken\n(ECB), Cornelia Holthausen (ECB) and Katerina \u0160m\u00eddkov\u00e1 (Czech National Bank) are workstream coordinators. Xavier Freixas\n(Universitat Pompeu Fabra) and Hans Degryse (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and Tilburg University) act as external consultant.\nAngela Maddaloni (ECB) and Kalin Nikolov (ECB) share responsibility for the MaRs Secretariat.\nThe refereeing process of this paper has been coordinated by a team composed of Cornelia Holthausen, Kalin Nikolov and Bernd\nSchwaab (all ECB).\nThe paper is released in order to make the research of MaRs generally available, in preliminary form, to encourage comments and suggestions\nprior to final publication.

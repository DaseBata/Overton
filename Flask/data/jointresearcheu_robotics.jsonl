At present, several organisations engage in developing global long-term population projections and provide varied results in terms of projected population size and structures. This diversity demonstrates that there is a need to reflect on the ingredients that feed into the projections. For this reason, the JRC, IIASA and the UN Population Division launched a survey where experts were asked to assess the validity and relevance of alternative arguments about the forces that could shape future fertility, mortality, and migration trends in the country of their choice. The results of the survey highlight that experts almost unanimously support the roles played by urbanisation, reductions in child mortality, greater educational attainment, and employment opportunities for women in decreasing fertility in high fertility countries.

It is argued that modernisation of the European Industry depends upon multiple innovations across many industrial areas linked to emerging value chains. Some European regions have access to leading R&D and upstream innovation facilities; others have industrial skills needed in downstream testing and industrial upscaling. This paper looks at how the new Industrial Modernisation Platform can help European regions to create and/or join transnational networks of knowledge and expertise, and drive the development of transnational and macro-regional value chains. Cooperation and outward-looking disposition promote an understanding of the competitive position of the country/region with regard to others, and with respect to global value chains.

This mapping provides a snap-shot of the ERA-NET landscape at the time of the analysis and involves collecting information along a range of dimensions that 'characterise' ERA-NETs (e.g. number of countries involved, joint activities developed, thematic coverage, etc.).

This last property is particularly valuable for accelerometers and gyroscopes to be used for inertial navigation, since it guarantees precise positioning without the need for frequent recalibrations, a shortcoming which affects several devices presently in use. High-performance inertial sensors play an important role both in space applications, where gyroscopes are widely used e.g. to orientate a satellite and its on-board communications and sensing

A number of FP7 projects certainly produce cutting-edge technologies and a significant percentage of these technologies could be commercialized.

The Innovation Radar (IR) is a support initiative that focuses on the identification of high-potential innovations in the ICT FP7, CIP and H2020 projects and the key organization in delivering these innovations to the market. The current report documents the details of the IR methodology and the results of its first application.

The overall vision is that personalisation, collaboration and informalisation (informal learning) are at the core of learning in the future. These terms are not new in education and training but will have to become the central guiding principle for organising learning and teaching in the future. The central learning paradigm is thereby characterised by lifelong and life-wide learning, shaped by the ubiquity of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).

This has led to a reduction in student numbers in courses related to nuclear energy, which in turn has led to the SUPPLY of human resources to the nuclear industry being reduced.One of the aims of this report is to inform students about the higher educational opportunities in the nuclear field available to them across Europe, so that they can make an educated choice of a field to study and consider working in the nuclear sector. This report also provides a mapping of what is happening in the educational and research institutions in the nuclear field in the EU-27. This is intended to help academia and industry to know about the different initiatives, to be complementary to each other and to collaborate for a continuous improvement of nuclear safety and security.In short, this report makes a contribution that allows both the SUPPLY institutions of human resources to the nuclear industry and the DEMAND stakeholders of these human resources to be aware of the existence of each other, to make contact, so that they can collaborate in making improvements in this sector.The report gives factual information for each of the countries of the EU relating to the situation with respect to nuclear power, the higher educational opportunities available and the companies involved in the nuclear industry. Much of the work to produce the report was carried out before the accident occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011. It is clear that this has led to a change in public opinion so that the support for nuclear power has reduced significantly. In addition, the future of the operating nuclear power plants and the need to build additional ones is being reconsidered by the governments in some countries. However, the factual information presented in the report describes the situation relating to nuclear power in each of the countries, the higher educational opportunities available and the companies involved in the nuclear industry.The contents of this report will be published and updated on the website of EHRO-N at http://ehron.jrc.ec.europa.eu.", "published_on": "2012-09-04", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC67016", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC67016/mapping_nuclear_stakeholders%28online%29_final.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/5ff5a2f88f3a63d5b210c2d7709e4dd0.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/5ff5a2f88f3a63d5b210c2d7709e4dd0.png", "topics": ["Nuclear energy", "Nuclear physics", "SCK CEN", "Nuclear power", "European Union", "Academic degree", "Fachhochschule", "Free University of Brussels (1834\u20131969)", "Nuclear technology", "RWTH Aachen University", "Physics", "Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain", "Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant", "Nuclear reactor", "Marcoule Nuclear Site", "Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant", "Technischer \u00dcberwachungsverein", "French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission", "Bologna Process", "Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles", "Helsinki University of Technology", "Bachelor's degree", "Energy"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["science and technology>natural science", "economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "science and technology>natural science>physics", "science and technology>natural science>physics>nuclear physics", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>energy and resource", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>energy and resource>nuclear power", "education", "science and technology"], "source_tags": ["Nuclear safety and security"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2790/40915", "10.2790/41101"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [], "policy": [], "news": [], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "Nuclear Technology EducationConsortium 1546 offers a MSc in Nuclear Science Technology distance learning 1547 in which thereare courses in: Criticality Safety Management;Decommissioning/Waste/EnvironmentalManagement; Decommissioning Technology Robotics; Management of the DecommissioningProcess; Nuclear Fuel Cycle; Nuclear Safety CaseDevelopment; Processing, Storage and Disposalof Nuclear Wastes; Radiation  RadiologicalProtection; Reactor Physics, Criticality Design; and Reactor Thermal Hydraulics", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC67016/mapping_nuclear_stakeholders%28online%29_final.pdf", "pdf_title": "PDF #1", "page": "118"}]}

The most common factor raised in the literature to explain the differences in dynamic structure between the US and the EU is a greater willingness on the part of the US financial markets to fund projects in new sectors. The more fragmented nature of Europe\u2019s product markets has also been cited as potential barrier to innovation in the region compared with the United States. For new sectors, this is particularly true of markets where early users are willing to take up and co-develop innovations. In addition, the lower exit and re-entry costs for firms and the greater mobility in the US labour market are factors which would encourage the emergence of new industries and new firms in the US. Nonetheless, part of the story is also the failure of the EU\u2019s innovation \u201cecosystem\u201d to effectively link its innovation actors.The current report aims to help address these issues \u2013 through the point of view of three separat...", "published_on": "2012-11-20", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC76458", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC76458/final%20lessons%20from%20ict%20innovative%20industries%20with%20cover2.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/ea1781d19b2be75e76f61d291a223937.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/ea1781d19b2be75e76f61d291a223937.png", "topics": ["Economy", "Business", "Human activities", "Technology", "Economic growth", "Trademark", "Smartphone", "Startup company", "Angel investor", "Research and development", "Market (economics)", "Digital Single Market", "European Union", "Private equity", "Patent", "Innovation", "Funding", "Intellectual property", "Venture capital", "Investment", "Network effect", "Information and communications technology", "Copyright", "Investor", "Competition", "Competition (economics)", "Finance", "Integrated circuit", "Software patent", "Android (operating system)", "Radio-frequency identification", "Subsidy", "Semiconductor intellectual property core", "Venture capital financing", "IPhone", "Invention", "Web 2.0", "Entrepreneurship", "Interoperability", "European Single Market", "Software", "Procurement"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>business information", "economy, business and finance>business information>strategy and marketing", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology", "economy, business and finance>economy", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology>software", "economy, business and finance>business information>strategy and marketing>patent, copyright and trademark"], "source_tags": ["Information society"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2791/22134", "9789279267833", "JRC76458", "EUR 25562 EN", "OP LF-NA-25562-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2307/3087475", "title": "When Does Start-Up Innovation Spur the Gale of Creative Destruction?", "journal": "The RAND Journal of Economics", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1016/b978-075068259-6.50005-1", "title": "Venture capital in Europe", "publisher": "Elsevier"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.ijindorg.2006.07.005", "title": "Innovation and the dynamics and evolution of industries: Progress and challenges", "journal": "International Journal of Industrial Organization", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.4337/9781847208781.00011", "title": "Venture Capital and Government Policy", "publisher": "Edward Elgar Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.2307/2696354", "title": "Assessing the Contribution of Venture Capital to Innovation", "journal": "The RAND Journal of Economics", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.respol.2007.01.002", "title": "Schumpeterian patterns of innovative activity in the ICT field", "journal": "Research Policy", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1287/mnsc.1110.1321", "title": "Entry and Patenting in the Software Industry", "journal": "Management Science", "publisher": "Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS)"}, {"doi": "10.3152/147154304781779787", "title": "System of innovation theory and the European Union", "journal": "Science and Public Policy", "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}, {"doi": "10.1111/1468-0327.00088", "title": "Venture capital in Europe and the financing of innovative companies", "journal": "Economic Policy", "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/5kmjp6nt8rr8-en", "title": "Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Financial Market Cycles", "journal": "OECD Science, Technology and Industry Working Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.respol.2010.02.012", "title": "Does Europe perform too little corporate R&D?

A framework for indicators is proposed to characterize the performance of ICT innovation systems. Due to the multi-purpose and pervasive nature of ICT, it is relevant to extend the innovation systems concept to the societal level. The resource-based view of the innovative firm fits very well with the innovation systems perspective. Patterns in the firm-level sets (combinations, or mix) of resources and capabilities can be identified with factor-analysis and they give rise to the main types or modes of innovative behaviour.

A decomposition analysis reveals that this pattern is due to the employment growth in jobs in Construction, Wholesale & retail trade, and Transport, storage and communication industries in India.

This leads to an increase of demand for materials used to manufacture key components of such technologies, and the European Commission has already flagged several of them as critical raw materials, which raise concerns on security of supply. An example of critical materials are rare earth elements, which are needed for the manufacturing of permanent magnets for wind turbine generators and electric vehicle motors, as well as for several applications in other fields. Those elements are currently supplied mainly from China, and with demands increasing at a rapid pace there are fears of supply bottlenecks and geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, following the rare earths crisis of the early 2010s, there have been increased efforts in geological exploration and development of alternative technologies, which may mitigate supply risks.

The study is carried out for all workers and also for different subgroups defined on the basis of gender, age, educational level and formality status. The results show a wide variation of structural change patterns between periods and countries. In Argentina, an inverted U-shaped pattern is found in employment growth for the period 2003\u201312, while a certain polarizing trend is observed between 2012 and 2019. In Chile, no clear pattern is identified between 2000 and 2009, and a certain pattern of upgrading is found from 2009 until 2017. In Mexico, there is no evidence of significant changes between 2006 and 2010, while an inverted U-shaped pattern is found in the following decade.

The discussion of the cases identified and studied in depth leads to the formulation of eight core-guiding principles, which can serve as a reference point for policy-makers for the design and implementation of digital education policies: 1. Follow a holistic approach targeting systemic change; 2. Establish both a long-term vision and short-term achievable goals; 3. Deploy technology as a means not an end; 4. Embrace experimentation, risk-taking and failure; 5. Consider the importance and the limits of impact assessment; 6. Involve all stakeholders in a structured dialogue; 7.

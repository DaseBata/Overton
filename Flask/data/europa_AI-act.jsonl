A data justice approach is one that centres on equity, recognition and representation of plural interests, and the creation and preservation of public goods as its principal goals. The analysis offers both an assessment of the EU data governance strategy overall and specific policy options for the AI act, the data governance act and the data act. Four benchmarks for good data governance are proposed, in line with the principles of justice: preserving and strengthening public infrastructure and public goods, inclusiveness, contestability and accountability, and global responsibility. Exploring examples of different governance models, we examine how these models and options intersect, and what lessons they offer for the EU case.", "published_on": "2022-07-26", "added_on":

As is the case with all innovative technologies, a thorough monitoring of the emerging AI field and its trends must be put in place in order to comprehend the reach of its impact. This exercise makes it possible to gain awareness about possible issues and situations requiring attention or intervention. In this respect, this publication provides an analysis of multiple indicators related to the development of AI from several perspectives. Although the geographical focus is on the EU27, when possible we provide a comparison with major worldwide AI powerhouses, i.e., the US and China, among others. Also, when available, an indicator is provided for the 27 EU Member States.

Current advances in AVs would not be possible without advances in AI systems. In fact, the most complex tasks that AVs have to deal with to achieve high levels of automation (i.e. localization, scene understanding, planning, control and user interaction), are addressed by using multiple, complex interrelated AI systems. Therefore, when referring to trustworthy AI systems for AVs, it seems acceptable to extrapolate the concept to refer to it as trustworthy AVs (as presented in the title of this report). The term trustworthy should not be interpreted in its literal sense, but as a global framework that includes multiple principles, requirements and criteria.

We begin by reviewing X-ray baggage screening technology, followed by a discussion on the importance of human-machine interaction. The different approaches to measuring and describing the performance of AI algorithms are summarised, and an overview of existing databases of X-ray images is given. An overview of image enhancement and threat detection using classical machine learning techniques is described followed by data augmentation then deep learning. We also describe some applications of machine learning to materials classification (as opposed to object detection). The report concludes by discussing some horizontal issues concerning the application of AI in X-ray baggage screening, including testing of algorithm performance, the need for large, harmonised

This information can be used to detect th e types of organic materials present on the surface. 4.3.2.2. Raman spectroscopy (RS) [7, 8] It is used to examine the energy levels of molecules that cannot be well character-ized via infrared spectroscopy. Th e two techniques, however, are complimentary. In the RS, a sample is irradiated with a strong monochromatic light source (usu-ally a laser). Most of the radiation will scatter or \"reflect off' the sample at the same energy as the incoming laser radiation. However, a small amount will scat-ter from the sample at a wavelength slightly shifted from the original wavelength. It is possible to study the molecular structure or determine the chemical identity of the sample. It is quite straightforward to identify compounds by spectral library search. Due to extensive library spectral information, the unique spectral finger-print of every compound, and the ease with which such analyses can be per-formed, the RS is a very useful technique for various applications. An important application of the RS is the rapid, nondestructive characterization of diamond, diamond-like, and amorphous-carbon films. 4.3.2.3. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) / energy dispersive X-ra y analysis (EDX) [7, 8] The SEM produce s detailed photographs that provide important information about the surface structure and morphology of almost any kind of sample. Image analy-sis is often the first and most important step in problem solving and failure analy-sis. With SEM, a focused beam of high-energy electrons is scanned over the sur-face of a material, causing a variety of signals, secondary electrons, X-rays, photons, etc. - each of which may be used to characterize the material with re-spect to specific properties . The signals are used to modulate the brightness on a CRT display, thereb y providing a high-resolution map of the selected material property. It is a surface imaging technique, but with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) it can identify elements in the near-surface region. This technique is most useful for imaging particles. 4.3.2.4. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) [7, 8] Incident X-rays are used to excite surface atoms. The atoms relax through the emission of an X-ray with energy characteristic of the parent atoms and the inten-sity proportional to the amount of the element present. It is a bulk or \"total mate-rials\" characterization technique for rapid, simultaneous, and nondestructive analysis of elements having an atomic number higher than that of boron. Tradi-tional bulk analysis applications include identifying metals and alloys, detecting trace elements in liquids, and identifying residues and deposits. 4.3.2.5. Total-reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) [7, 8] It is a special XRF technique that provides extremely sensitive measures of the elements present in a material's outer surface. Applications include searching for metal contamination in thin films on silicon wafers and detecting picogram-levels o f arsenic, lead, mercury and cadmium on hazardous, chemical fume hoods.",

It also employs anchors, like Faster RCNN, but the difference is that instead of fixing the anchor parameters, this approach makes use of k-means clustering over the input data to learn the anchor parameters of the ground truth bounding boxes. YOLOv2 also performs batch normalization after each layer, resulting in an improvement in the overall performance. Finally, unlike classification networks that inputs smaller size images such as 224 x 224 pixels, YOLOv2 accepts inputs with higher resolution varying between 350 x 350 to 600 x 600 pixels. Besides, the model randomly resizes input images during the training, which allows the network to work with objects with varying scales, and hence handles scaling issue. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8100173/", "matched_news_outlet": "CNN"}], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "Trustworthy AI in April 2019  proposing a set of non-binding recommendationsregarding AI.

The study focuses on three key elements of platforms: the digital devices used at work, the digital monitoring of work, and the use of algorithms for work organisation. These three elements are studied in three different contexts: regular work settings, Digital Labour Platforms and content sharing platforms. The implications of these new forms of work for work organisation and working conditions are also discussed.

This is an important step in the transformation of European electricity generation, but only a small one compared to the planned goal of 55 % greenhouse gas reductions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050 in Europe.  The EU countries will need huge investments in infrastructure to transport renewable energies from the locations of their generation to the locations of consumption. Furthermore, for the desired transformation of European electricity generation, both pricing and taxation of energies (and greenhouse gas emissions) need to be coordinated such that the EU remains competitive and effective incentives are set.  Global data also show that the overall electricity transition is not progressing in line with climate targets. Clean power generation is not yet being built fast enough to keep pace with the rising electricity demand. Wind and solar power plants make up the bulk, but their growth has slowed in recent years. Even the temporary drop in electricity demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic is not enough to put the world on track and electricity demand will undoubtedly pick up soon, especially as the world seeks to electrify all sectors that still rely on fossil fuels. Solutions and more ambition worldwide are needed urgently.       European Union  The chart below shows the EU's energy sources since 2020.     The graph below shows the ratio of renewable to fossil energy sources in various European countries in 2020.     The EU has set itself the goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050. The graph below shows the targets for 2030 and 2050 compared to the CO2 emissions since 1990.      The graph below shows electricity prices in Euro per kWh in different European countries. The extreme differences are an important aspect for competitiveness.

Whereas most of the biggest platforms have so far avoided explicit alignment with any specific political agenda \u2013 at least seen from the North Atlantic perspective \u2013 this could change. Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter is a case in point, given his history of spreading anti-science narratives, and his strong business ties with authoritarian actors such as Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. Since taking control, he has fired key executives and lowered protections against racist and hate speech and delivered a string of pro-Republican messages. These have increased concern about the risks of a major platform taking a highly partisan approach. In a similar way, an existing social media company could decide to work towards boosting a specific partisan, anti-democratic agenda. New platforms \u2013 launched by non-democratic states or state actors, or even pushed by anti-democratic non-state actors in a democratic country \u2013 could covertly or overtly further an ideological, anti-democratic agenda, exploiting vulnerable audiences. In such a scenario, the social media platforms in question could, for example, customise their algorithms to give preference to anti-democratic or anti-EU views and people. Ultimately, one or more large platforms with an anti-democratic agenda could use its algorithmic power to manipulate the public to vote for anti-democratic actors, foment widespread unrest and/or overthrow elected governments. In this scenario, EU legislation and action would fail to address the risks posed by algorithms to political debate and could ultimately fall victim to weaponisation of the infosphere. https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/4/29/as-musk-eyes-twitter-china-and-india-dissidents-fear-censorshiphttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/business/media/elon-musk-politics-twitter.htmlhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2022/738199/EPRS_BRI(2022)738199_EN.pdf", "matched_news_url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/4/29/as-musk-eyes-twitter-china-and-india-dissidents-fear-censorshiphttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/business/media/elon-musk-politics-twitter.htmlhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2022/738199/EPRS_BRI(2022)738199_EN.pdf", "matched_news_outlet": "Al Jazeera"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/technology/china-generation-blocked-internet.html", "matched_news_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/technology/china-generation-blocked-internet.html", "matched_news_outlet": "The New York Times"}, {"reference_string": "Resilience against natural disasters and assuring connectivity without disruptions: Global internet connectivity is at risk from climate disasters such as flooding, storms and hurricanes, as these types of extreme weather events are becoming more likely due to climate change.

However, progress has varied between Member States. In some, increasing prices and the changing political landscape and priorities have not been conducive to the smooth implementation of the agreed investments and reforms. Whereas payments have been highest in Spain (53.3 % of the approved resources), Lithuania (37.4 %), Greece (36.4 %), Croatia (35.2 %) and Italy (34.9 %), countries such as Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Sweden and the Netherlands have not received a single euro. In particular, unblocking the resources in Hungary and Poland depends on politically tough reforms related to the rule of law. In some countries, the difficulties in fulfilling certain milestones and targets have resulted in the decision to postpone requests for payments or to amend the NRRP. This is the case, for instance, for the plans of Belgium, Germany, Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Moreover, there are signals that Italy, the biggest beneficiary of the RRF, after a good start, is beginning to struggle to meet the conditions for the next payments.

More than eight in 10 people will live in Asia or Africa by the end of the century; their increasing importance manifests itself, for example, in Africa's demand for G20 membership and its renewed call for reform of the UN Security Council (UNSC), indicating the continent's quest for a greater say in world affairs. https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/emerging-asia-will-produce-more-than-half-of-global-output-by-20-201811.html https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/foresight/topic/expanding-influence-east-south/power-shifts_en https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/03/26/africas-population-will-double-by-2050 https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/05/the-worlds-peak-population-may-be-smaller-than-expected https://ourworldindata.org/region-population-2100#:%7E:text=The%20UN%20projects%20that%20the,the%20end%20of%20the%20century. https://issafrica.org/pscreport/psc-insights/multilateralism-takes-centre-stage-at-36th-au-summit", "matched_news_url": "https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/05/the-worlds-peak-population-may-be-smaller-than-expected", "matched_news_outlet": "The Economist"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/xi-putin-summit-russia-inches-closer-china-new-cold-war-looms", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/xi-putin-summit-russia-inches-closer-china-new-cold-war-looms", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-sanctions-plan-targets-russian-banks-companies-and-imports-if-ukraine-is-attacked-11643387219", "matched_news_url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-sanctions-plan-targets-russian-banks-companies-and-imports-if-ukraine-is-attacked-11643387219", "matched_news_outlet": "The Wall Street Journal"}, {"reference_string": "By 2028, China had incrementally altered the status quo in the Taiwan Strait with salami-slicing tactics. Despite Western export controls, it had caught up with Taiwan in advanced semiconductor manufacturing, even outcompeting it thanks to the vast economies of scale and gravitational pull of its huge market. Taiwan had lost its protective shield as a unique global hub for state-of-the-art chip manufacturing. After the gradual loss to China of a major share of its chips trade, Taiwan had faced mounting difficulties in sustaining the growing military budget necessary to acquire asymmetric defence capabilities, exacerbating a rising weapons backlog. In parallel, China had enacted legislation requiring foreign commercial shipments to and from Taiwan to be reloaded in Chinese ports and to be carried to and from Taiwan by Chinese cargo shuttles. To enforce its legislation applicable to Taiwan's trade, China had leveraged access to its critical raw materials and inputs required for the digital and green transition and offered inducements to foreign carriers to use alternative shipping routes through the Arctic. China had thereby gradually gained control of Taiwan's trade and essential food and energy supplies. https://thediplomat.com/2022/12/why-europe-struggles-with-us-export-controls-on-china/#:%7E:text=In%20October%202022%2C%20the%20United,semiconductor%20manufacturing%20equipment%20(SME).https://www.ft.com/content/baa27f42-0557-4377-839b-a4f4524cfa20https://www.bruegel.org/podcast/lessons-chinas-semiconductor-technology-pushhttps://www.dw.com/en/taiwans-military-tests-new-capabilities-to-deter-china-threat/a-61129158https://warontherocks.com/2023/01/the-real-reasons-for-taiwans-arms-backlog-and-how-to-help-fill-it/https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2018/620231/EPRS_BRI(2018)620231_EN.pdf https://thediplomat.com/2022/09/taiwans-greatest-vulnerability-is-its-energy-supply/", "matched_news_url": "https://thediplomat.com/2022/09/taiwans-greatest-vulnerability-is-its-energy-supply/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Diplomat"}, {"reference_string": "China's statistical office also confirmed that China's population has decreased by 0.85 million compared to 2021, the first officially confirmed decline in population in the recent past (although the decline might actually have set in earlier).

Consequently, in May 2022, the European Commission proposed REPowerEU, an initiative allowing the EU to phase out its dependency on Russian fossil fuels and bolstering green initiatives. In response, Russia has re-routed its energy exports to India and China. When it comes to nuclear energy, dependency on Russian raw material imports is unchanged (around 20 %) and has still to be tackled. So far, EU Member States' behaviour on this has spanned from stalling (Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden), to reducing (Bulgaria) and even increasing (Finland, Hungary and Slovakia) imports of nuclear-related materials. https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2022/699496/EPRS_BRI(2022)699496_EN.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_3131 https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/russia-says-it-has-rerouted-all-oil-exports-india-the-biggest-buyer/ https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-just-cant-quit-russia-for-nuclear-power/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-just-cant-quit-russia-for-nuclear-power/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-troop-build-up-sparks-unintended-nato-renewal-2022-01-20/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-troop-build-up-sparks-unintended-nato-renewal-2022-01-20/", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-titles-chairman.html", "matched_news_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-titles-chairman.html", "matched_news_outlet": "The New York Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://time.com/6242854/china-zero-covid-reversal-xi-jinping/", "matched_news_url": "https://time.com/6242854/china-zero-covid-reversal-xi-jinping/", "matched_news_outlet": "Time Magazine"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-04/russia-inc-staggers-into-1998-times-three-with-foreign-exodus?leadSource=uverify%20wall", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-04/russia-inc-staggers-into-1998-times-three-with-foreign-exodus?leadSource=uverify%20wall", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-send-leopard-tanks-ukraine-russia-war-rheinmetall/#:%7E:text=Berlin%20OKs%20German%20arms%2Dmaker,the%20older%20Leopards%20to%20Kyiv.&text=The%20German%20government%20has%20approved,a%20government%20spokesperson%20said%20Friday.", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-send-leopard-tanks-ukraine-russia-war-rheinmetall/#:%7E:text=Berlin%20OKs%20German%20arms%2Dmaker,the%20older%20Leopards%20to%20Kyiv.&text=The%20German%20government%20has%20approved,a%20government%20spokesperson%20said%20Friday.", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/03/edf-to-reduce-nuclear-power-output-as-french-river-temperatures-rise", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/03/edf-to-reduce-nuclear-power-output-as-french-river-temperatures-rise", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-apec-china-taiwan-idUSBRE99503Q20131006", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-apec-china-taiwan-idUSBRE99503Q20131006", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Finally, another risk could arise from historical experience, according to which political leaders facing serious domestic problems tend to seek to distract from them by forging ahead with foreign policy action.

Hossain and Hallock (2022) highlight that political grievances against governments considered unable to provide citizens with the basic necessities of life also play an important role in economically difficult contexts. Social factors also play a part, particularly a tradition and culture of protest at national level. An IMF working paper by Redl & Hlatshwayo (2021) that uses a machine learning technique to analyse drivers of social unrest shows that the most frequent predictor of unrest is the previous occurrence of unrest in the same country or in neighbouring countries, well ahead of inflation and food prices (around 10 times more predictive than these). Based on this model, EU countries that have experienced frequent protests in the recent past are most likely to experience it again. Developments since 2022 have confirmed this trend, but have also seen a resurgence of protests in northern European countries, which have been less exposed to protests in the recent past. New EU Member States which experienced particular economic difficulties, including some of the highest inflation rates in Europe (such as the Baltic States) did not, at least initially, witness significant protests over inflation, despite its brutal impact on the purchasing power of the population. Commentators explained this apparently paradoxical state through experience of inflation in the recent past, and a feeling of national unity in the face of hardship caused by a deeply unjust war on their doorsteps. Gradually, however, social protests by disaffected professional groups also extended their grip (e.g. in Hungary and Romania). https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021263-print-pdf.ashx https://www.politico.eu/article/energy-crisis-food-and-fuel-protests-surged-in-2022-the-biggest-were-in-europe/ https://www.ft.com/content/cf88d42a-6b59-4520-9c70-638b267c8de0 https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2022/12/09/strikes-sackings-and-soaring-prices-teacher-anger-rages-in-hungary https://www.romania-insider.com/romanian-government-beset-strikes-public-sectors-2023", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/cf88d42a-6b59-4520-9c70-638b267c8de0", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-inflation-pain-you-dont-see-middle-class-after-tax-income-necessities-food-cloting-healthcare-rand-11671479731", "matched_news_url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-inflation-pain-you-dont-see-middle-class-after-tax-income-necessities-food-cloting-healthcare-rand-11671479731", "matched_news_outlet": "The Wall Street Journal"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/ukraine-crisis-germany-influencers/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/ukraine-crisis-germany-influencers/", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-iran-pledge-to-deepen-ties-amid-ukraine-war-11668013676", "matched_news_url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-iran-pledge-to-deepen-ties-amid-ukraine-war-11668013676", "matched_news_outlet": "The Wall Street Journal"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://thediplomat.com/2023/01/taiwan-politics-outlook-a-kmt-resurgence/", "matched_news_url": "https://thediplomat.com/2023/01/taiwan-politics-outlook-a-kmt-resurgence/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Diplomat"}, {"reference_string": "Given ongoing climate change, critical internet infrastructures are likely to be increasingly exposed to weather conditions and natural disasters that cause failures. Another factor to take into account when assessing the risk probability of internet failure is the pace of innovation.

Furthermore, the strategies adopted by firms also have an impact on how the risk of internet failure could materialise.

The creation of cable protection zones (e.g. banning certain types of anchoring and fishing) in critical areas within national waters would help to avoid unintentional severing of cables by following the examples set in Australia and New Zealand. In this respect, a European Parliament analysis suggested that Parliament could invite maritime authorities to suggest solutions. A 2022 policy brief by the Atlantic Centre considered investing in submarine cables' sensors/detection systems on critical points to be a useful tool to detect potential physical threats; Member States should envisage the use of such detection systems as part of licence requirements for landing submarine cables and the EU could sponsor research in this field and make recommendations on the allocation of licences. Finally, following the example of the Australian government, which appears to have concluded that ownership of certain submarine cables is of strategic concern, a European Commission study recommends that the EU create a comprehensive and common approach to support EU-based companies in the development and construction of new secure submarine cable routes. A European review of submarine cable ownership and risk assessment for future submarine cable projects might help in making potential strategic decisions. https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Undersea-Cables.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EXPO_IDA(2022)702557https://www.defesa.gov.pt/pt/pdefesa/ac/pub/acpubs/Documents/Atlantic-Centre_PB_13.pdfhttps://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/3/737/pdf?version=1581329530https://cerre.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GGDE_FulIReport.pdfhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-solomonislands-internet/australia-keeps-china-out-of-internet-cabling-for-pacific-neighbor-idUSKBN1J90JYhttps://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/a0b01654-9394-11ec-b4e4-01aa75ed71a1https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/eu-eyes-arctic-internet-cable-to-connect-europe-to-asia-via-alaska/https://oceans-and-fisheries.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-03/join-2023-8_en.pdf https://www.ft.com/content/d07dbd19-5e8b-4543-85f6-bbf1a6a0858d", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d07dbd19-5e8b-4543-85f6-bbf1a6a0858d", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/03/10/china-brokers-an-iran-saudi-rapprochement", "matched_news_url": "https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/03/10/china-brokers-an-iran-saudi-rapprochement", "matched_news_outlet": "The Economist"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/64648e10-cc09-4304-a274-87b66d37d3bc", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/64648e10-cc09-4304-a274-87b66d37d3bc", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/d07dbd19-5e8b-4543-85f6-bbf1a6a0858d", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d07dbd19-5e8b-4543-85f6-bbf1a6a0858d", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/addb6645-e517-4c44-82d4-213d66d21a0c", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/addb6645-e517-4c44-82d4-213d66d21a0c", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/technology/chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence.html", "matched_news_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/technology/chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence.html", "matched_news_outlet": "The New York Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/world/moscow-may-sabotage-undersea-cables-part-its-war-ukraine-nato-2023-05-03/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/moscow-may-sabotage-undersea-cables-part-its-war-ukraine-nato-2023-05-03/", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-anti-satellite-threat-tests-laws-war-space-2022-10-28/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-anti-satellite-threat-tests-laws-war-space-2022-10-28/", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-dive-deeper-undersea-security-after-nord-stream-attacks-2022-10-11/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-dive-deeper-undersea-security-after-nord-stream-attacks-2022-10-11/", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/02/24/un-ukraine-resolution-vote-countries/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/02/24/un-ukraine-resolution-vote-countries/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Washington Post"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/15/world/brazil-president-ukraine-war-intl/index.html#:%7E:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20United%20States%20needs%20to,Lula%20told%20reporters%20in%20Beijing.", "matched_news_url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/15/world/brazil-president-ukraine-war-intl/index.html#:%7E:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20United%20States%20needs%20to,Lula%20told%20reporters%20in%20Beijing.", "matched_news_outlet": "CNN"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/46cfa976-d8a4-4514-8c79-f4003d3005df", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/46cfa976-d8a4-4514-8c79-f4003d3005df", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bbc.com/news/world-63636181", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-63636181", "matched_news_outlet": "BBC News"}], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "could be promoted to candidates, parties and stakeholders in the US.

Trump could draw on the policy work of Republican think-tanks, such as the America First Policy Institute and the Heritage Foundation. The latter's 'Project 2025' sets out a broad policy agenda 'by and for conservatives'. Critics argue that it, inter alia, suggests a push for alignment of career civil servants, the alleged 'deep state', with America First policies pursuant to Trump's 2020 executive order, known as Schedule F, which Biden revoked. Observers argue that the plan to 'deconstruct the Administrative State', which would also affect the Department of Justice, would pose a threat to US democracy. Experts expect major shifts in the US approach to allies, international organisations, climate and energy, but some continuity on China. Republicans reject climate change policies, except when they target China, support fossil fuel industries and seek to undo Biden's green transition bills and dismantle related offices in federal agencies. https://www.economist.com/international/2023/07/11/what-would-europe-do-if-trump-won https://americafirstpolicy.com/team https://www.heritage.org/press/former-trump-appointee-troup-hemenway-joins-heritages-project-2025 https://www.project2025.org/policy/ https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/07/13/the-meticulous-ruthless-preparations-for-a-second-trump-term https://www.axios.com/2022/07/22/trump-2025-radical-plan-second-term https://www.ft.com/content/4a14c19e-8285-4688-aa19-542023520798 https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-creating-schedule-f-excepted-service/ https://www.opm.gov/news/releases/2023/09/release-biden-harris-administration-issues-proposed-rule-to-reinforce-and-clarify-protections-for-the-nonpartisan-career-civil-service/ https://protectdemocracy.org/work/biden-admin-response-schedule-f/ https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4282732-trump-pledges-to-direct-completely-overhauled-doj-to-probe-das-and-ags/ https://www.ft.com/content/758cc4d2-976f-4d7e-bee4-028ae5c15f30 https://ecfr.eu/publication/brace-yourself-how-the-2024-us-presidential-election-could-affect-europe/ https://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-06.pdf#page=9 https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/at-debate-republican-presidential-candidates-tout-fossil-fuels-vow-to-undo-bidens-climate-initiatives/ https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/tariff-climate-pollution-environment https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/house-republicans-pass-energy-bill-to-roll-back-regulation-of-fossil-fuel-production https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/28/far-right-climate-plans-00107498 https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/17/what-they-are-saying-one-year-anniversary-of-the-inflation-reduction-act/ https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/27/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-driving-forward-on-convenient-reliable-made-in-america-national-network-of-electric-vehicle-chargers/ https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/27/project-2025-dismantle-us-climate-policy-next-republican-president", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/27/project-2025-dismantle-us-climate-policy-next-republican-president", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Prosecution of the crime of aggression (incorporated in the ICC's jurisdiction with the Kampala Conference in 2010) requires formally being a state party (after ratification of the Rome Statute). The mere acceptance of ICC jurisdiction is not sufficient. For this reason, other options to address the crime of aggression, such as the establishment of an ad hoc international tribunal, have been explored by scholars, who are not unanimous. The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe have all supported the proposal of a special tribunal. The Commission has also discussed the establishment of an ad hoc or hybrid court, i.e. an international court integrated into Ukraine's judicial system, although this option presents legal challenges and uncertainties. On 15 March 2023, the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber II issued arrest warrants against Vladimir Putin and his Commissioner for children's rights, Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, with the allegation of having committed the war crime of unlawful deportation of children and unlawful transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation. This entails that states party to the Rome Statute are obliged to arrest the addressees of the warrants if they enter their territory. ICC jurisdiction indeed is not prevented by immunities such as those of heads of state or holders of other state functions (Article 27 SoR). Failing such arrest, no trial can take place as the ICC may not hear cases without the physical presence of the accused (Article 63(1) SoR). The Russian Federation issued in its turn arrest warrants against several judges involved in the above case, raising concerns of the UN Human Rights Office. https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XVIII-10-b&chapter=18&clang=_en#:%7E:text=The%20Review%20Conference%20of%20the%20Rome%20Statute%2C%20held%20in%20Kampala,651.2010https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-icc-prosecutor-karim-aa-khan-qc-situation-ukraine-i-have-been-closely-followinghttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2022/702574/EXPO_IDA(2022)702574_EN.pdfhttps://academic.oup.com/jcsl/article/28/2/203/7081290http://opiniojuris.org/2022/03/07/creating-a-special-tribunal-for-aggression-against-ukraine-is-a-bad-idea/https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-ursula-von-der-leyen-propose-set-up-court-russia-war-crime-ukraine/https://www.nato-pa.int/download-file?filename=/sites/default/files/2022-11/RESOLUTION%20479%20-%20%20NATO%20POST%20MADRID%20.pdfhttps://pace.coe.int/en/news/8699/pace-calls-for-the-setting-up-of-an-ad-hoc-international-criminal-tribunal-to-hold-to-account-perpetrators-of-the-crime-of-aggression-against-ukrainehttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/11/30/eu-russia-ukraine-tribunal-war-crimes/https://www.justsecurity.org/85019/why-hybrid-ukrainian-tribunal-on-crime-of-aggression-is-not-the-answer/https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-vladimir-vladimirovich-putin-andhttps://www.justsecurity.org/85597/how-will-icc-arrest-warrant-for-putin-play-out/https://www.justsecurity.org/68801/head-of-state-immunity-is-too-important-for-the-international-court-of-justice/https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/Publications/Rome-Statute.pdf https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-adds-icc-judge-who-issued-putin-warrant-wanted-list-media-2023-05-19/ https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/russia-puts-another-icc-judge-who-issued-warrant-for-putin-on-wanted-list/3047610 https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/10/1142287", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-adds-icc-judge-who-issued-putin-warrant-wanted-list-media-2023-05-19/", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Spending billions to develop a range of ICEs, with different technical requirements, is obviously not needed to produce electric cars.

finally arrived at the level of EU Heads of State or Government. Recent developments, including court rulings at both EU and Member State levels alluding to the rule of law, indicate that deep divisions persist in the EU regarding the understanding of democracy and European values; observers argue that the EU's rule of law crisis is still far from being resolved. EU leaders' various discussions have not led to a solution on the issue, but rather postponed direct action at European level for the moment. Consequently, EU leaders might need to return to this topic again in the near future. At their meeting of 24-25 March 2022, the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, urged EU leaders to use the current 'window of opportunity' to find a way forward on the rule of law. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-22-2020-INIT/en/pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694201/EPRS_BRI(2021)694201_EN.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694243/EPRS_BRI(2021)694243_EN.pdfhttps://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-10/cp210192en.pdf https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=244185&pageIndex=0&doclang=FR&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=1699703 https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-legal-eu-court-reprimand-disciplinary-procedure-for-judges/ https://www.politico.eu/article/five-ways-the-eus-democracy-crisis-could-end/ https://eu.boell.org/en/2020/12/18/after-crisis-crisis-rule-law-headache-wont-go-away https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220324IPR26159/this-is-our-moment-president-metsola-to-eu-leaders", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/five-ways-the-eus-democracy-crisis-could-end/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/24/elon-musks-crew-dragon-puts-america-back-in-the-space-race", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/24/elon-musks-crew-dragon-puts-america-back-in-the-space-race", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46764500", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46764500", "matched_news_outlet": "BBC News"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/euco-council-eu-viktor-orban-charles-michel-hungary-poland-migration-mutiny-eu-summit-deadlocks/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/euco-council-eu-viktor-orban-charles-michel-hungary-poland-migration-mutiny-eu-summit-deadlocks/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Taxation has been a very visible topic in the EU in recent years.

However, they also noted the importance of preserving the level playing field and the 'integrity of the single market' whilst maintaining Europe's global competitiveness. The growing use of subsidies worldwide, more particularly the adoption of the US IRA, has caused concern for some in the EU, as it is considered as a discriminatory instrument, violating WTO rules and with potentially damaging effect on the EU's green tech industry. Despite differing views on how or whether to change State aid policy, the European Council agreed that it was imperative for the EU to be competitive and productive, particularly in sectors connected to the digital and green transitions. In February and March 2023, the European Council agreed that State aid policy needed adjusting in order to become simpler, faster and more predictable, allowing for temporary and proportionate support. Finding the correct balance between enabling State aid to support EU industry and preserving the level playing field in the single market will be a critical issue for the EU and its Member States to resolve over the coming months. To monitor these developments, the European Council has asked the Commission to report regularly on the impact of State aid policy on the single market as well as on the EU's competitiveness globally. https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2022)743681 https://www.oecd.org/subsidies/ https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/ https://borderlex.net/2023/02/21/think-tank-responding-to-the-united-states-green-tech-subsidies/ https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2023)739300 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/why-eu-objects-to-us-green-subsidies-tax-breaks-quicktake?cmpid=BBD012723_BRUS&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=230127&utm_campaign=brussels&leadSource=uverify%20wall https://epthinktank.eu/2023/02/07/outlook-for-the-special-european-council-meeting-of-9-10-february-2023/#:%7E:text=and%20Annastiina%20Papunen.-,EU%20Heads%20of%20State%20or%20Government%20will%20gather%20on%209,migration%20and%20the%20EU%27s%20economy. https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/european-council/2023/02/09/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/why-eu-objects-to-us-green-subsidies-tax-breaks-quicktake?cmpid=BBD012723_BRUS&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=230127&utm_campaign=brussels&leadSource=uverify%20wall", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-wto-usa-idUSKBN29Y22R", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-wto-usa-idUSKBN29Y22R", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-26/ecb-s-lane-sees-services-driving-growth-despite-german-recession#xj4y7vzkg", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-26/ecb-s-lane-sees-services-driving-growth-despite-german-recession#xj4y7vzkg", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-russia-gas-winter-energy-nord-stream-pipeline-ukraine-war/#:%7E:text=The%20EU%27s%20reserves%20of%20natural,away%20from%20Russian%20energy%20dependence.", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-russia-gas-winter-energy-nord-stream-pipeline-ukraine-war/#:%7E:text=The%20EU%27s%20reserves%20of%20natural,away%20from%20Russian%20energy%20dependence.", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/meps-pledge-chatgpt-rules-call-for-international-ai-action-in-letter/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/meps-pledge-chatgpt-rules-call-for-international-ai-action-in-letter/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.businessinsider.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chat-gpt-2023-1?r=US&IR=T", "matched_news_url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chat-gpt-2023-1?r=US&IR=T", "matched_news_outlet": "Business Insider"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/09/01/russia-attacks-ukraine-farm-economy/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/09/01/russia-attacks-ukraine-farm-economy/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Washington Post"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-hopes-hold-peace-summit-this-autumn-zelenskiy-2023-08-02/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-hopes-hold-peace-summit-this-autumn-zelenskiy-2023-08-02/", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "is not achieved, both sides could re-introduce billions of euros in trade tariffs.

Both sides agreed to boost regional and continental economic integration through trade.

However, in their joint statement the EU and the AU agreed to engage 'constructively towards an agreement on a comprehensive WTO response to the pandemic, which includes trade-related, as well as intellectual property related aspects'.

In 2018, the European Commission put forward two proposals for fair and effective taxation of the digital economy: a short-term solution, to be delivered by an interim digital services tax on revenues from certain digital services, and a permanent reform of corporate tax rules, based on the concept of 'significant digital presence'. Progress at EU level was stalled in an effort to find a global solution with the OECD. At the July 2020 European Council meeting, EU leaders tasked the Commission with putting forward a proposal on a digital levy in the first semester of 2021, considering ongoing OECD negotiations. As agreed in the interinstitutional agreement of 16 December 2020, such a levy was due to be one of the EU budget's new 'own resources' that would contribute to paying off EU debts incurred to finance the recovery package as well as play an important role in the fair taxation of digital companies. In December 2021, the Commission proposed a directive on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups in the Union, which closely follows the international agreement with adjustments to ensure compliance with EU law. In April 2022 at the Economic and Financial Affairs Council meeting, Poland vetoed the latest compromise proposal by the French Presidency, thereby blocking the file. It has been reported that the file has been blocked as a means to pressure the European Commission into approving the Polish recovery plans. https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_3564https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/company-tax/fair-taxation-digital-economy_enhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45109/210720-euco-final-conclusions-en.pdf https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.LI.2020.433.01.0028.01.ENG https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/long-term-eu-budget/2021-2027/revenue/potential-new-sources-revenue_en https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0823&qid=1641150862839 https://newsroom.consilium.europa.eu/events/20220405-economic-and-financial-affairs-council-april-2022/134695-1-press-conference-part-1-20220405 https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/black-death-rule-of-law-polands-blockade/ https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/poland-blocks-eu-directive-to-implement-global-corporate-tax-deal/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/black-death-rule-of-law-polands-blockade/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "producing a proposal as rapidly as possible.

The European Council stated in March 2019 that it looks forward 'to the Commission's recommendation on a concerted approach to the security of 5G networks'. The recommendation was published a few days after the European Council meeting. Since then, the security of 5G networks, and especially the involvement of the Chinese technology giant Huawei in building the networks, has been a widely discussed topic, notably following the move by the US to block Huawei from its market and to encourage its allies to adopt a similar approach. On 29 January 2020, the Commission published the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity, in which it outlined a set of key actions to ensure the security of the networks, such as limiting dependency on a single supplier and assessing the risk profile of supplies. The multivendor approach has been interpreted by Huawei as meaning that it will be able to take part in building the European 5G networks. The Commission has called on the Member States to 'take concrete and measurable steps' to implement key toolbox measures. EU leaders discussed 5G at their meeting on 1-2 October 2020 and stressed that 'potential 5G suppliers need to be assessed on the basis of common objective criteria' and asked the Member States to send their national plans on the roll-out of 5G to the Commission to 'ensure the rapid deployment of 5G across the EU'. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-1-2019-INIT/en/pdf https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154 https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123 https://agenceurope.eu/en/bulletin/article/12414/7 https://huawei.eu/press-release/huawei-media-statement-following-publication-european-commissions-5g-security-toolbox https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_127 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45910/021020-euco-final-conclusions.pdf?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=European+Council+conclusions%2c+1-2+October+2020", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "Another challenging factor during the coronavirus crisis has been the German federal constitutional court's critical ruling on the European Central Bank's bond buying programme, which has met with mixed reactions. https://www.ft.com/content/a1beda5e-5c2d-429e-a095-27728ed2d72b https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_20_846 https://www.ft.com/content/f48e3a6b-6a95-4187-8a7d-0f8dad3fbecb", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f48e3a6b-6a95-4187-8a7d-0f8dad3fbecb", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Letter-to-Vestager.pdf?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=194a035c23-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_02_06_06_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-194a035c23-189690569", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Letter-to-Vestager.pdf?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=194a035c23-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_02_06_06_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-194a035c23-189690569", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "In the digital age, earning profit in a country no longer necessarily requires setting-up factories or offices on the ground, but can be effected by offering products or services through digital platforms. This results in the difficulty of localising value creation, and as a result, the ensuing taxation questions become increasingly complicated. The issue has caused some transatlantic tensions, as the United States (US) has a very strong 'big tech' digital presence around the world. The US has raised the possibility to impose unilateral tariffs if EU countries were to go ahead with a digital levy. In its March 2021 meeting, the European Council has expressed its preference for and commitment to a global solution within the OECD framework. However, it did not rule out a unilateral EU move if a global solution was not achieved. The European Parliament adopted its position on the matter in April 2021, emphasising that the global solution was the preferred one, but not the only way forward. Multilateral talks finally resulted in an agreement at OECD level in July 2021, the details of which were finalised on 8 October 2021. In the end, all EU Member States accepted to endorse the deal and to be included in the digital taxation framework, which was endorsed by the G20 leaders' meeting in Rome on 31 October. The agreement envisages a global minimum tax rate of at least 15 % and is designed to clarify tax revenue sharing among countries for multinational companies making profits in countries without a physical presence, especially by big digital companies. In July 2021, the European Commission announced that it would suspend work on its own digital levy until the autumn to prioritise the global agreement, although under the interinstitutional agreement of 16 December 2020 this initiative was supposed to be put forward by June 2021. The OECD/G20 agreement has been welcomed by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and Commissioner Gentiloni has hailed its formal endorsement by the G20. https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-to-postpone-digital-tax-proposal/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/48976/250321-vtc-euco-statement-en.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0147_EN.htmlhttps://www.oecd.org/newsroom/130-countries-and-jurisdictions-join-bold-new-framework-for-international-tax-reform.htmhttps://www.oecd.org/tax/oecd-leading-multilateral-efforts-to-address-tax-challenges-from-digitalisation-of-the-economy.htmhttps://www.ft.com/content/3e3e6a7d-67d5-437d-a7b2-29c52ce9c78fhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/52732/final-final-g20-rome-declaration.pdf https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.LI.2020.433.01.0028.01.ENG https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_21_5166 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_5247", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-to-postpone-digital-tax-proposal/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/48976/250321-vtc-euco-statement-en.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0147_EN.htmlhttps://www.oecd.org/newsroom/130-countries-and-jurisdictions-join-bold-new-framework-for-international-tax-reform.htmhttps://www.oecd.org/tax/oecd-leading-multilateral-efforts-to-address-tax-challenges-from-digitalisation-of-the-economy.htmhttps://www.ft.com/content/3e3e6a7d-67d5-437d-a7b2-29c52ce9c78fhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/52732/final-final-g20-rome-declaration.pdf", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "As this global agreement needed to be turned into an EU law \u2013 requiring the unanimous agreement of all 27 Member States, in December 2021, the Commission proposed a directive on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups in the Union, which closely follows the international agreement with adjustments to ensure compliance with EU law.

The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) was developed as part of the introduction of the euro and was reinforced in the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis. The framework aims to keep countries' deficit below 3 % of economic output and their public debt below 60 %. Current rules allow Member States some leeway to bend the rules and get away without any fines, which could, if applied (not applied until now) amount to 0.2 % of the country's GDP. Eurozone debt decreased slightly to 95.6 % of economic output (88.1 % of GDP in EU as a whole) in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 100 % at the end of the first quarter, with the highest levels reached in Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium and Cyprus. The Commission has relaunched the debate on the review of EU economic governance, which had begun before the pandemic; the crisis led the EU to suspend the rules in March 2020 by activating the so-called general escape clause. This move enabled governments to take a supportive fiscal stance and to support their economies in the face of the economic and social impact of the pandemic. The rules are set to be applied again only in 2023 on the basis of the Commission's spring 2021 economic forecast. https://pro.politico.eu/news/138913 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/14497745/2-22042022-BP-EN.pdf/90896015-2ac1-081a-2eef-ad8d5f2c0da1 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_5374 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/economic-governance-review_en https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2722", "matched_news_url": "https://pro.politico.eu/news/138913", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/porto-summit-11-eu-countries-national-authority/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/porto-summit-11-eu-countries-national-authority/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52450854", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52450854", "matched_news_outlet": "BBC News"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/8da39299-b257-4e8f-9b83-a84a8930f1c1", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8da39299-b257-4e8f-9b83-a84a8930f1c1", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/oecd-global-tax-deal-reached-g20/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/oecd-global-tax-deal-reached-g20/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-taxation-united-states-digital-tax-corporate-tax/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-taxation-united-states-digital-tax-corporate-tax/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/event/france-to-the-fore/#event-program", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/event/france-to-the-fore/#event-program", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/business/ukraine-russia-wheat-prices.html", "matched_news_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/business/ukraine-russia-wheat-prices.html", "matched_news_outlet": "The New York Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/china-says-ecs-carbon-border-tax-is-expanding-climate-issues-trade-2021-07-26/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/china-says-ecs-carbon-border-tax-is-expanding-climate-issues-trade-2021-07-26/", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/de7d12e2-0d04-43d4-b38c-cf795854a4a2", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/de7d12e2-0d04-43d4-b38c-cf795854a4a2", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "In recent weeks and months, the EU-China relationship has further deteriorated.

However, it is also becoming clear that the influence of the pandemic was more significant in 2021 than during the previous year &#8211; for instance, &#39;excess mortality&#39; increased even further, while life expectancy decreased in many Member States. The pandemic also accelerated another phenomenon, present in our lives in recent decades: the digital transition. Social distancing measures favoured automation and digitisation, an increased use of e-government, and led to higher rates of remote working. Parallel to this, new problems and challenges appeared, touching diverse demographic groups in different ways and to differing degrees.

In the digital age, earning profit in a country no longer necessarily requires settingup factories or offices on the ground, but can be effected by offering products or services through digital platforms. This results in the difficulty of localising value creation, and as a result, the ensuing taxation questions become increasingly complicated. The issue has caused some transatlantic tensions, as the United States (US) has a very strong 'big tech' digital presence around the world. The US has raised the possibility to impose unilateral tariffs if EU countries were to go ahead with a digital levy. In its March 2021 meeting, the European Council has expressed its preference for and commitment to a global solution within the OECD framework. However, it did not rule out a unilateral EU move if a global solution was not achieved. The European Parliament adopted its position on the matter in April 2021, emphasising that the global solution was the preferred one, but not the only way forward. Multilateral talks finally resulted in an agreement at OECD level in July 2021, the details of which were finalised on 8 October 2021. In the end, all EU Member States accepted to endorse the deal and to be included in the digital taxation framework, which was endorsed by the G20 leaders' meeting in Rome on 31 October. The agreement envisages a global minimum tax rate of at least 15 % and is designed to clarify tax revenue sharing among countries for multinational companies making profits in countries without a physical presence, especially by big digital companies. In July 2021, the European Commission announced that it would suspend work on its own digital levy until the autumn to prioritise the global agreement, although under the interinstitutional agreement of 16 December 2020 this initiative was supposed to be put forward by June 2021. The OECD/G20 agreement has been welcomed by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and Commissioner Gentiloni has hailed its formal endorsement by the G20. Its implementation is envisaged in the 2022 Commission work programme. https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-to-postpone-digital-tax-proposal/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/48976/250321-vtc-euco-statement-en.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0147_EN.htmlhttps://www.oecd.org/newsroom/130-countries-and-jurisdictions-join-bold-new-framework-for-international-tax-reform.htmhttps://www.oecd.org/tax/oecd-leading-multilateral-efforts-to-address-tax-challenges-from-digitalisation-of-the-economy.htmhttps://www.ft.com/content/3e3e6a7d-67d5-437d-a7b2-29c52ce9c78fhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/52732/final-final-g20-rome-declaration.pdfhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.LI.2020.433.01.0028.01.ENGhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_21_5166https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_5247https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar%3A9fb5131e-30e9-11ec-bd8e-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_2&format=PDF", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-to-postpone-digital-tax-proposal/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/48976/250321-vtc-euco-statement-en.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0147_EN.htmlhttps://www.oecd.org/newsroom/130-countries-and-jurisdictions-join-bold-new-framework-for-international-tax-reform.htmhttps://www.oecd.org/tax/oecd-leading-multilateral-efforts-to-address-tax-challenges-from-digitalisation-of-the-economy.htmhttps://www.ft.com/content/3e3e6a7d-67d5-437d-a7b2-29c52ce9c78fhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/52732/final-final-g20-rome-declaration.pdfhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.LI.2020.433.01.0028.01.ENGhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_21_5166https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_5247https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar%3A9fb5131e-30e9-11ec-bd8e-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_2&format=PDF", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Taxation has been a very visible topic in the EU in recent years.

On 29 January 2020, the Commission published the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity, in which it outlined a set of key actions to ensure the security of the networks, such as limiting dependency on a single supplier and assessing the risk profile of supplies.

The Commission has called on the Member States to 'take concrete and measurable steps' to implement key toolbox measures. EU leaders discussed 5G at their meeting on 1-2 October 2020 and stressed that 'potential 5G suppliers need to be assessed on the basis of common objective criteria' and asked the Member States to send their national plans on the roll-out of 5G to the Commission to 'ensure the rapid deployment of 5G across the EU'. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-1-2019-INIT/en/pdf https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154 https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123 https://agenceurope.eu/en/bulletin/article/12414/7 https://huawei.eu/press-release/huawei-media-statement-following-publication-european-commissions-5g-security-toolbox https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_127 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45910/021020-euco-final-conclusions.pdf?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=European+Council+conclusions%2c+1-2+October+2020", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "Current challenges in the area of migration relate not only to internal disagreements in the EU, but also to the recent actions of a number of third countries, which believe that irregular migration can be used as a means to exert pressure on the EU. Countries, including Turkey and Morocco, have threatened to or actually did allow migrants in large numbers to cross EU borders illegally, thereby 'weaponising migration'. Most recently, in the summer of 2021, Belarus started to fly in refugees and to direct them to Lithuania in reaction to EU sanctions, opening another migration route to the EU. At its meeting of 24-45 June 2021, the European Council condemned and rejected any attempt by third countries to 'instrumentalise migrants for political purposes'. European Council President, Charles Michel reiterated this message on 5 July and pledged solidarity with Lithuania. The situation remained charged in August, with over 4 000 migrants having crossed from Belarus into Lithuania this year (compared with 74 in 2020 and just 37 in 2019) and others arriving at the Latvian and Polish borders. Consequently, the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU organised an extraordinary videoconference meeting of interior ministers within the framework of the Council's crisis response mechanism (IPCR), a tool used by EU countries to coordinate during acute crises. Ministers expressed their solidarity with Latvia, Lithuania and Poland and voiced support for providing additional assistance at these external EU borders. In this context, on 7 October 2021, interior ministers from 12 Member States sent a letter to Margaritis Schinas, Vice-President of the European Commission, and Ylva Johansson, Commissioner for Home Affairs, asking 'to adapt the existing legal framework to the new realities'. They noted, in particular, that 'a physical barrier appears to be an effective border protection measure', and proposed that measures in this regard should be 'additionally and adequately funded from the EU budget as a matter of priority'. Following the 21-22 October European Council, President von der Leyen outlined the EU's current and future support for Member States' border management, but also stated that 'there will be no [EU] funding of barbed wire and walls'. https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-says-it-will-no-longer-stop-refugees-from-entering-europe/https://ecfr.eu/article/this-time-is-different-spain-morocco-and-weaponised-migration/https://euobserver.com/world/152305https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694201/EPRS_BRI(2021)694201_EN.pdfhttps://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/1412102714427953159https://euobserver.com/migration/152583https://euobserver.com/tickers/152632https://euobserver.com/tickers/152619https://twitter.com/EU2021SI/status/1425462408731049995https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/en/news/home-affairs-ministers-express-solidarity-with-the-eu-member-states-at-the-border-with-belarus/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/ipcr/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=0ca76056ca-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_08_12_05_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-0ca76056ca-189688461https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/media/y5uoszrv/ipcr-presidency-statement-final_18-8-2021.pdfhttps://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/07/Joint-letter_Adaptation-of-EU-legal-framework-20211007.pdf https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/media-galleries/european-council/meetings/2021-10-21-22-euco/?slide=0", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-says-it-will-no-longer-stop-refugees-from-entering-europe/https://ecfr.eu/article/this-time-is-different-spain-morocco-and-weaponised-migration/https://euobserver.com/world/152305https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694201/EPRS_BRI(2021)694201_EN.pdfhttps://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/1412102714427953159https://euobserver.com/migration/152583https://euobserver.com/tickers/152632https://euobserver.com/tickers/152619https://twitter.com/EU2021SI/status/1425462408731049995https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/en/news/home-affairs-ministers-express-solidarity-with-the-eu-member-states-at-the-border-with-belarus/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/ipcr/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=0ca76056ca-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_08_12_05_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-0ca76056ca-189688461https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/media/y5uoszrv/ipcr-presidency-statement-final_18-8-2021.pdfhttps://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/07/Joint-letter_Adaptation-of-EU-legal-framework-20211007.pdf", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "The issue of rule of law developments in Poland was added to the agenda of the 21-22 October European Council at the last moment.

Under pillar one, potential solutions are being examined by the Council to determine where tax should be paid and what portion of profits should be taxed. A broad outline of a unified approach on pillar one has been agreed as the basis for further negotiations at the end of January 2020, followed by the endorsement by the G20 finance ministers on 23 February 2020. However, the Commission will examine whether a directive is needed to ensure the consistent and effective implementation of pillar one at EU level. In July, the G20 Finance Ministers mandated the OECD to develop a blueprint on the design of the two pillars ahead of their next meeting on 15-16 October 2020; they were published on 12 October 2020. Under pillar two, a system will be designed to ensure that multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax. On 25 March 2021, the European Council stated the urgent need to address tax challenges resulting from digitalisation and highlighted their preference for a global solution by mid-2021 within the framework of the OECD. In June 2021, the G7 agreed on a global minimum corporate income tax rate of 15 %. The new rules would adjust taxing rights to countries where large multinational enterprises earn their profits. In October 2021, 136 countries agreed to support the tax reform, while four 13 countries have not yet backed the new two-pillar tax package. Three EU Member States (Ireland, Estonia and Hungary) recently joined the agreement; thus all Member States are now officially supporting the tax reform. In the EU, the agreement will need an EU law to be passed and that will require the unanimous agreement of all 27 Member States. https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/130-countries-and-jurisdictions-join-bold-new-framework-for-international-tax-reform.htmhttps://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/oecd-presents-analysis-showing-significant-impact-of-proposed-international-tax-reforms.htmhttps://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-13405-2019-INIT/en/pdfhttps://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/statement-by-the-oecd-g20-inclusive-framework-on-beps-january-2020.pdfhttps://agenceurope.eu/en/bulletin/article/12432/12https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_5247https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/oecd-g20-inclusive-framework-on-beps-invites-public-input-on-the-reports-on-pillar-one-and-pillar-two-blueprints.htmhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/48976/250321-vtc-euco-statement-en.pdf https://www.politico.eu/article/oecd-global-tax-deal-reached-g20/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/oecd-global-tax-deal-reached-g20/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/event/france-to-the-fore/#event-program", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/event/france-to-the-fore/#event-program", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/3e3e6a7d-67d5-437d-a7b2-29c52ce9c78f", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3e3e6a7d-67d5-437d-a7b2-29c52ce9c78f", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/business/eu-commission-puts-hold-plan-digital-services-levy-2021-07-12/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/business/eu-commission-puts-hold-plan-digital-services-levy-2021-07-12/", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/de7d12e2-0d04-43d4-b38c-cf795854a4a2", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/de7d12e2-0d04-43d4-b38c-cf795854a4a2", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-5g-arson-attacks-online-theories/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-5g-arson-attacks-online-theories/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-giants-new-appeal-to-governments-please-regulate-us-11580126502", "matched_news_url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-giants-new-appeal-to-governments-please-regulate-us-11580126502", "matched_news_outlet": "The Wall Street Journal"}, {"reference_string": "Given the serious human, economic and social consequences of the health crisis, criticism has been directed towards the lack of overall preparedness in combatting the pandemic across the EU, and the lack of coordination among Member States at the start of the outbreak.

This new form of meetings has enabled EU leaders in a context of lockdown to take joint action to tackle the crisis. Considering the particular nature of the European Council however, and notably the importance of small bilateral meetings on the side-lines in achieving agreements, video meetings are unlikely to replace physical meetings fully when crucial decisions are on the agenda. In such a format, EU leaders tend to be more cautious and keep to their written statements since the confidentiality of discussions is not ensured and participation is broader than in formal physical meetings. After months of remote meetings, the European Council was able to convene again in person on 17-21 July 2020 when EU leaders discussed and reached a political agreement on the MFF and the recovery package. In the first half of 2021, EU Heads of State or Government were back online as the third wave of coronavirus hit Europe, but were able to meet in person again in June and October 2021. https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/04/23/conclusions-by-president-charles-michel-following-the-video-conference-with-members-of-the-european-council-on-23-april-2020/https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/can-the-eu-be-run-by-videolink-confidentiality-is-the-biggest-problem/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45109/210720-euco-final-conclusions-en.pdf", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/04/23/conclusions-by-president-charles-michel-following-the-video-conference-with-members-of-the-european-council-on-23-april-2020/https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/can-the-eu-be-run-by-videolink-confidentiality-is-the-biggest-problem/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45109/210720-euco-final-conclusions-en.pdf", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://pro.politico.eu/news/136998", "matched_news_url": "https://pro.politico.eu/news/136998", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/8da39299-b257-4e8f-9b83-a84a8930f1c1", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8da39299-b257-4e8f-9b83-a84a8930f1c1", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-australia-trade-deal-runs-aground-over-submarine-furor/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-australia-trade-deal-runs-aground-over-submarine-furor/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-taxation-united-states-digital-tax-corporate-tax/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-taxation-united-states-digital-tax-corporate-tax/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-wto-usa-idUSKBN29Y22R", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-wto-usa-idUSKBN29Y22R", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/post-brexit-talks-sefcovic-northern-ireland/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/post-brexit-talks-sefcovic-northern-ireland/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/china-says-ecs-carbon-border-tax-is-expanding-climate-issues-trade-2021-07-26/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/china-says-ecs-carbon-border-tax-is-expanding-climate-issues-trade-2021-07-26/", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "of discussions oncurrent legislative acts, such as the Data GovernanceAct, Roaming, and the updated privacy rules forelectronic communications ePrivacy.

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the EU decided to cut out its dependency on Russian fossil fuels, and the Commission is to present by mid- May 2022 a phasing-out plan by 2027. By supporting the twin transition, which would include more home-grown renewables and a higher of nuclear power, the EU could further reduce its energy dependency on fossil fuels.

The EU and NATO are also stepping up cooperation. https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2279 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2021)698037 https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-by-the-secretary-of-state-of-the-united-states-of-america-and-the-eu-high-representative-for-foreign-affairs-and-security-policy-vice-president-of-the-european-commission-2/ https://www.politico.eu/article/live-blog-ukraine-invasion-putin-donetsk-luhansk/ https://www.state.gov/u-s-eu-joint-press-release-by-the-eeas-and-department-of-state-on-the-second-high-level-meeting-of-the-u-s-eu-dialogue-on-china/ https://useu.usmission.gov/launch-of-the-u-s-eu-dialogue-on-china/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/live-blog-ukraine-invasion-putin-donetsk-luhansk/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "The EU has also shown itself willing to advance trade integration with democratic and nondemocratic partners alike. In December 2020, a 'political agreement' was announced on a comprehensive agreement on investment (CAI) with China, shortly before the Biden Administration took office. Some observers argued that the CAI undercut transatlantic cooperation on the challenges China poses to the multilateral trading system. In addition, while the EU has successfully concluded FTAs with Japan and Canada (even if the latter awaits ratification by all Member States), progress on FTAs with other democratic partners is slower than might have been expected: negotiations with Australia were delayed by the diplomatic dispute between that country and France over the AUKUS announcement, while France reportedly sought to postpone the conclusion of negotiations with New Zealand and Chile until after its presidential election.

media are often used and abused for political campaigns and propaganda. Furthermore, their digital transformation has had a profound impact on democratic politics. The disappearance of numerous newspapers, many of them local, has undermined civic engagement and political participation. The spread of social media and online news sources has made information more accessible, but has also contributed to the dissemination of fake news and disinformation. Meanwhile, there is a risk that measures to counter disinformation unnecessarily restrict freedom of expression. Increasing attacks and intimidation against journalists, traditionally considered to occur in authoritarian regimes, are also affecting developed democracies, often provoked and encouraged by populist or corrupt politicians.

At EU level, the coordination of efforts to respond to a pandemic (e.g. procurement) must be improved, and there must be more investment https://www.undp.org/blog/investing-pandemic-preparedness-all https://theconversation.com/5-strategies-to-prepare-now-for-the-next-pandemic-154317", "matched_news_url": "https://theconversation.com/5-strategies-to-prepare-now-for-the-next-pandemic-154317", "matched_news_outlet": "The Conversation"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/ec2f93ad-d23c-4ff4-867a-59385d1cc8a6", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ec2f93ad-d23c-4ff4-867a-59385d1cc8a6", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51707958", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51707958", "matched_news_outlet": "BBC News"}, {"reference_string": "Sohn J., Wall Street Journal, Semiconductor industry is not spending big on scarce old-tech chips, 9 November 2021. https://www.wsj.com/articles/semiconductor-industry-isnt-spending-big-on-scarce-old-tech-chips-11636453801", "matched_news_url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/semiconductor-industry-isnt-spending-big-on-scarce-old-tech-chips-11636453801", "matched_news_outlet": "The Wall Street Journal"}, {"reference_string": "8 The Independent Panel, 'COVID-19: Make it the Last Pandemic A Summary', May 2021. https://theindependentpanel.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Summary_COVID-19-Make-it-the-Last-Pandemic_final.pdf", "matched_news_outlet": "The Independent"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/09/02/a-virtual-counter-revolution", "matched_news_url": "https://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/09/02/a-virtual-counter-revolution", "matched_news_outlet": "The Economist"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/d72145b7-5e44-446a-819c-51d67c5471cf", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d72145b7-5e44-446a-819c-51d67c5471cf", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/opinion/facebook-privacy.html", "matched_news_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/opinion/facebook-privacy.html", "matched_news_outlet": "The New York Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/46069192-7261-4959-b46d-2e30092bce8d", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/46069192-7261-4959-b46d-2e30092bce8d", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/9bbe5c6a-fb37-4f1e-b405-2538657898ea", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9bbe5c6a-fb37-4f1e-b405-2538657898ea", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/03/gop-trump-baseless-election-fraud-claims-518603", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/03/gop-trump-baseless-election-fraud-claims-518603", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://theconversation.com/canadians-shouldnt-take-for-granted-the-recent-peaceful-transition-after-the-election-167513", "matched_news_url": "https://theconversation.com/canadians-shouldnt-take-for-granted-the-recent-peaceful-transition-after-the-election-167513", "matched_news_outlet": "The Conversation"}, {"reference_string": "In this scenario, political polarisation is here to stay, being inherent to democracies, and populism is one of its unavoidable poles. After the polarisation around Covid-19 vaccines, anger over rising energy prices \u2013 whether due to sanctions against Russia or the need for green policies \u2013 could provide fuel for the next generation of populists, along the lines of the gilets jaunes. Concerning the rule of law, this third scenario would mean that struggles to uphold judicial independence vis-\u00e0-vis the legislative and executive would become the 'new normal', possibly providing for periods of government domination over the judiciary and an erosion of the rule of law, followed by periods of democratic and rule of law progress.

At that meeting, Heads of State or Government adopted a statement on anti-terrorism measures, vowing to take stronger measures against terrorist threats in the coming months. As mentioned previously, the meeting of 17-18 December 2015, following the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, constitutes a clear example of a major agenda change, with the European Council dedicating significant time to internal security and/or terrorism, although the issues had not originally been foreseen on the agenda. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-shooting/french-foreign-leaders-walk-arm-in-arm-as-millions-protest-paris-attacks-idUSKBN0KK05S20150111?utm_source=Facebook https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/02/12/european-council-statement-fight-against-terrorism/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-shooting/french-foreign-leaders-walk-arm-in-arm-as-millions-protest-paris-attacks-idUSKBN0KK05S20150111?utm_source=Facebook", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "With the debates at the European Council meetings of 10-11 December 2020, 24-25 June 2021 and 21-22 October 2021, the issue of EU values has finally arrived at the level of EU Heads of State or Government. Recent developments, including court rulings at both EU and Member State levels alluding to the rule of law, indicate that deep divisions persist in the EU regarding the understanding of democracy and European values; observers argue that the EU's rule of law crisis is still far from being resolved. EU leaders' various discussions have not led to a solution on the issue, but rather postponed direct action at European level for the moment.

However, they also noted the importance of preserving the level playing and the 'integrity of the single market' whilst maintaining Europe's global competitiveness. The growing use of subsidies worldwide, more particularly the adoption of the US IRA, has caused concern for some in the EU, who see it as discriminatory and a violation of WTO rules, and as having a potentially damaging effect on the EU green tech industry. Despite differing views on how or whether to change State aid policy, the European Council agreed that it was imperative for the EU to be competitive and productive, particularly in sectors connected to the digital and green transitions. The European Council has agreed that State aid policy needs adjusting in order to become simpler, faster and more predictable, allowing for temporary and proportionate support. Finding the correct balance between enabling State aid to support EU industry and preserving the level playing field in the single market will be a key challenge for the EU and its Member States over the coming months. To monitor these developments, the European Council has asked the Commission to report regularly on the impact of State aid policy on the single market as well as on the EU's competitiveness globally.

The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) was developed as part of the introduction of the euro and was reinforced in the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis. The framework aims to keep countries' deficit below 3 % of economic output and their public debt below 60 %. Current rules allow Member States some leeway to bend the rules and get away without any fines, which could, if applied (not applied until now) amount to 0.2 % of the country's GDP. Eurozone debt decreased slightly to 95.6 % of economic output (88.1 % of GDP in EU as a whole) in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 100 % at the end of the first quarter, with the highest levels reached in Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium and Cyprus. The Commission has relaunched the debate on the review of EU economic governance, which had begun before the pandemic; the crisis led the EU to suspend the rules in March 2020 by activating the so-called general escape clause. This move enabled governments to take a supportive fiscal stance and to support their economies in the face of the economic and social impact of the pandemic. The rules are set to be applied again only in 2023 on the basis of the Commission's spring 2021 economic forecast. https://pro.politico.eu/news/138913 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/14497745/2-22042022-BP-EN.pdf/90896015-2ac1-081a-2eef-ad8d5f2c0da1 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_5374 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/economic-governance-review_en https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2722", "matched_news_url": "https://pro.politico.eu/news/138913", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Another challenging factor during the coronavirus crisis has been the German federal constitutional court's critical ruling on the European Central Bank's bond buying programme, which has met with mixed reactions. https://www.ft.com/content/a1beda5e-5c2d-429e-a095-27728ed2d72b https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_20_846 https://www.ft.com/content/f48e3a6b-6a95-4187-8a7d-0f8dad3fbecb", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f48e3a6b-6a95-4187-8a7d-0f8dad3fbecb", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Taxation has been a very visible topic in the EU in recent years.

The European Council stated in March 2019 that it looks forward 'to the Commission's recommendation on a concerted approach to the security of 5G networks'. The recommendation was published a few days after the European Council meeting. Since then, the security of 5G networks, and especially the involvement of the Chinese technology giant Huawei in building the networks, has been a widely discussed topic, notably following the move by the US to block Huawei from its market and to encourage its allies to adopt a similar approach. On 29 January 2020, the Commission published the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity, in which it outlined a set of key actions to ensure the security of the networks, such as limiting dependency on a single supplier and assessing the risk profile of supplies. The multivendor approach has been interpreted by Huawei as meaning that it will be able to take part in building the European 5G networks. The Commission has called on the Member States to 'take concrete and measurable steps' to implement key toolbox measures. EU leaders discussed 5G at their meeting on 1-2 October 2020 and stressed that 'potential 5G suppliers need to be assessed on the basis of common objective criteria' and asked the Member States to send their national plans on the roll-out of 5G to the Commission to 'ensure the rapid deployment of 5G across the EU'. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-1-2019-INIT/en/pdf https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154 https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123 https://agenceurope.eu/en/bulletin/article/12414/7 https://huawei.eu/press-release/huawei-media-statement-following-publication-european-commissions-5g-security-toolbox https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_127 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45910/021020-euco-final-conclusions.pdf?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=European+Council+conclusions%2c+1-2+October+2020", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "With the debates at the European Council meetings of 10-11 December 2020, 24-25 June 2021 and 21-22 October 2021, the issue of EU values has finally arrived at the level of EU Heads of State or Government. Recent developments, including court rulings at both EU and Member State levels alluding to the rule of law, indicate that deep divisions persist in the EU regarding the understanding of democracy and European values; observers argue that the EU's rule of law crisis is still far from being resolved. EU leaders' various discussions have not led to a solution on the issue, but rather postponed direct action at European level for the moment. Consequently, EU leaders might need to return to this topic again in the near future. At their meeting of 24-25 March 2022, the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, urged EU leaders to use the current 'window of opportunity' to find a way forward on the rule of law. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-22-2020-INIT/en/pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694201/EPRS_BRI(2021)694201_EN.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694243/EPRS_BRI(2021)694243_EN.pdfhttps://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-10/cp210192en.pdf https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=244185&pageIndex=0&doclang=FR&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=1699703 https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-legal-eu-court-reprimand-disciplinary-procedure-for-judges/ https://www.politico.eu/article/five-ways-the-eus-democracy-crisis-could-end/ https://eu.boell.org/en/2020/12/18/after-crisis-crisis-rule-law-headache-wont-go-away https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220324IPR26159/this-is-our-moment-president-metsola-to-eu-leaders", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/five-ways-the-eus-democracy-crisis-could-end/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "The EU supports the abovementioned tax package, even though it has been working on its own digital tax to deal with the issue. In 2018, the European Commission put forward two proposals for fair and effective taxation of the digital economy: a short-term solution, to be delivered by an interim digital services tax on revenues from certain digital services, and a permanent reform of corporate tax rules, based on the concept of 'significant digital presence'. Progress at EU level was stalled in an effort to find a global solution with the OECD. At the July 2020 European Council meeting, EU leaders tasked the Commission with putting forward a proposal on a digital levy in the first semester of 2021, considering ongoing OECD negotiations. As agreed in the interinstitutional agreement of 16 December 2020, such a levy was due to be one of the EU budget's new 'own resources' that would contribute to paying off EU debts incurred to finance the recovery package as well as play an important role in the fair taxation of digital companies. In December 2021, the Commission proposed a directive on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups in the Union, which closely follows the international agreement with adjustments to ensure compliance with EU law. In April 2022 at the Economic and Financial Affairs Council meeting, Poland vetoed the latest compromise proposal by the French Presidency, thereby blocking the file. It has been reported that the file has been blocked as a means to pressure the European Commission into approving the Polish recovery plans. https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_3564https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/company-tax/fair-taxation-digital-economy_enhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45109/210720-euco-final-conclusions-en.pdf https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.LI.2020.433.01.0028.01.ENG https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/long-term-eu-budget/2021-2027/revenue/potential-new-sources-revenue_en https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0823&qid=1641150862839 https://newsroom.consilium.europa.eu/events/20220405-economic-and-financial-affairs-council-april-2022/134695-1-press-conference-part-1-20220405 https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/black-death-rule-of-law-polands-blockade/ https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/poland-blocks-eu-directive-to-implement-global-corporate-tax-deal/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/black-death-rule-of-law-polands-blockade/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "In the strategic agenda, the European Council stated that the EU would continue to update its competition framework, taking into account new technological and global market developments.

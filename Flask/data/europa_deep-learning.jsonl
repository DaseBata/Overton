Assessing key competences and transversal skills is a challenging task, as they refer to complex constructs that are not easily measurable. Although assessment policies that support the assessment of traditional key competences such as maths, languages and science have largely been implemented, they are often limited to the contexts provided by the subject matters with which they are most closely associated, and rarely assess related attitudes. Cross-curricular competences and transversal skills are harder to associate with individual subjects and to reflect in specific learning outcomes.

One of the main reasons for such heterogeneity is that there is no agreement on what ITE curricula should particularly emphasise (McKenzie et al., 2005). Another important reason is that ITE operates in varied institutional and organisational settings. In their mapping of ITE in Europe, Buchberger et al. (2000) distinguish between traditional and new ITE models based on common patterns in the emphasis and content of the curriculum (Buchberger et al., 2000). They argue that the new models are strongly influenced by more traditional models.

By atypical work we means forms of work which appear to be increasing in response to the new ways in which societies are organising economic production, but which as yet still affect only a minority of Europe\u2019s workers. The report considers several forms of atypical work, using the organising concepts of work time, employment contracts, work location, and, job detachment. It provides a number of concrete examples some of these practices are linked to the growth of ICTs. The report suggests that technology is only one of the drivers leading towards new work patterns. Others include globalisation, increased competition, feminisation of the workforce, change in consumer attitudes and lifestyles. Within this context ICTs facilitate change, but they do not predetermine outcomes.

Moreover, almost EUR 21 billion was allocated to companies through Advance Purchase Agreements. While the EU and MS support through Advance Purchase Agreements was key to de-risk the production of vaccines, the role of EU and MS support in directly supporting R&D was marginal compared with the US federal government.

Potential synergies mainly depend on the bottom-up process of selecting strategic objectives in the SF Operational Programmes during which the combination of more than one funding source should be internalised at a planning stage. The major overlap appears in the support for research infrastructure under SF and FP7.

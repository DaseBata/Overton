Data from 2010 and 2011 show that these percentages are growing over time, highlighting the increasing importance of the Internet in the overall economy.", "published_on": "2013-07-12", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k43gjg6r8jf-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/999ba9101496a1276e4711a69334df9f.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/999ba9101496a1276e4711a69334df9f.png", "topics": ["Economic growth", "Internet", "Gross domestic product", "Productivity", "Customer to customer", "Digital economy", "Business-to-business", "Economy", "Market (economics)", "System of National Accounts", "Economics", "Education", "Search cost", "E-government", "Retail", "Public good (economics)", "Smart grid", "Advertising", "National accounts", "Value (economics)", "Research", "Internet access", "Computer network", "Information and communications technology", "EHealth", "Price dispersion", "Macroeconomics", "Economic impact analysis", "Business", "Social capital", "E-commerce", "Infrastructure", "Price", "Simulation", "Social networking service", "Economic surplus", "Economy of the United States", "Statistics", "Information", "Health care", "Electrical grid", "Google Ads", "Technology", "Innovation", "Online and offline", "Quantitative research", "Externality", "Consumption (economics)", "Pricing", "Online advertising", "OECD", "Econometrics", "Profit (economics)", "EBay", "Big data", "Health", "Auction", "Data", "Labour economics", "Social network"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology", "economy, business and finance>economy", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>media", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>transport"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Working paper", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/5k43gjg6r8jf-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1353/eca.2004.0006", "title": "Exploding Productivity Growth: Context, Causes, and Implications", "journal": "Brookings Papers on Economic Activity", "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press"}, {"doi": "10.2307/3087454", "title": "Market Segmentation and the Sources of Rents from Innovation: Personal Computers in the Late 1980s", "journal": "The RAND Journal of Economics", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1787/230445718605", "title": "The Seoul Declaration for the Future of the Internet Economy", "journal": "OECD Digital Economy Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/eco_studies-v2001-art13-en", "title": "Measuring productivity", "journal": "OECD Economic Studies", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/5js7t9wqzvg8-en", "title": "The Proliferation of \u201cBig Data\u201d and Implications for Official Statistics and Statistical Agencies", "journal": "OECD Digital Economy Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/eco_studies-v2002-art5-en", "title": "The contribution of information and communication technologies to economic growth in nine OECD countries", "journal": "OECD Economic Studies", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/5k9bcwkg3hwf-en", "title": "Measuring the Broadband Bonus in Thirty OECD Countries", "journal": "OECD Digital Economy Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/5k9h2q8v9bln-en", "title": "ICT Applications for the Smart Grid", "journal": "OECD Digital Economy Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/eco_studies-2010-5km33scwlvkf", "title": "Does Computer Use Increase Educational Achievements?

This paper provides an analytical framework centred around the concepts of comparative advantage, complementarities, and innovation. There is strong evidence that India has a strong and sustainable comparative advantage in software development and IT-enabled services. Complementarities \u2014 in particular some form of domestic hardware industry as well as growing demand for software within the domestic market \u2014 are also important to sustain the growth of the IT sector, as well as to broaden its developmental impact. The paper also reviews innovative experiments of IT use to improve interactions between citizens and governments, farmers and corporations, and students and teachers in rural areas.

Following a review of the recent literature, the paper develops two main types of analysis. First, a detailed statistical analysis is undertaken drawing on the trade preferences database developed by the Secretariat and covering the Quad countries and Australia. This includes a presentation of the structure of tariff regimes in these key developed countries and identification of countries and sectors that are most reliant on tariff preferences. The second analytical approach uses the standard model and database of the Global Trade Analysis Project to simulate trade liberalisation scenarios that would entail preference erosion. While highlighting a number of cases of preference reliance, the paper underscores the advantages of multilateral liberalisation. Globally and for a majority of developing regions, liberalisation by preference-granting countries will result in positive welfare gains, notwithst...", "published_on": "2005-04-26", "added_on":

It builds on an online expert workshop that explored this question from the perspectives of both psychology and computer science. The volume consists of expert contributions that review skills taxonomies and tests in different domains of psychology, and efforts in computer science to assess AI and robotics.

It has a crucial role to play as global economies recover from the current financial crisis. This book examines the role of innovation in developing countries, with a focus on Africa. It investigates innovation systems and their application; the key role of knowledge in innovation for development; and the importance of comparable country studies and official statistics on innovation. It stresses the need for innovation to become part of a comprehensive development agenda, and makes recommendations for promoting activities in both the formal and informal sectors, with the aim of transforming agriculture into a knowledge-based industry capable of stimulating economic growth.Innovation and the Development Agenda is an important component of the overall OECD Innovation Strategy, which seeks to create stronger and more sustainable growth, while addressing the key global challenges of the 21st century.

Adopters tend to be highly productive and larger than other firms, while young adopters tend to hire AI workers more intensively.

Stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations at 450 to 550 parts per million will require policy changes along with innovation and large-scale adoption of GHG-reducing technologies throughout the global energy system. Innovations will need to be supported by international cooperation and behavioral changes to further realize the benefits of technological advances. Much discussion has therefore focused on policies that target technology directly, including research and development (R&amp;D) activities and technology-specific incentives, as well as policies and agreements that increase diffusion and adoption.

National emissions data are rarely disaggregated by freight vs. passenger transport, but an estimate is that goods transportation accounts for 30-40% of the total road sector emissions in most countries (ITF, 2010). In addition, the trend for CO2 emissions from the transportation of goods is on the rise, while the increase in emissions from passenger transport has levelled off and emissions from other sectors have decreased. Internationally, based on traditional projections, transportation of goods is expected to continue increasing in step with the GDP, thus doubling by 2050. This trend contrasts sharply with the climate targets set by the EU, which require dramatic reductions in emissions; by 2050, the EU should cut its emissions to 80% below 1990 levels through domestic reductions alone (EU, 2011).

The paper shows that the digital transformation affects the economics of information and knowledge, in particular pricing and allocation. The reduced costs of producing and handling information and knowledge and the increased fluidity change innovation dynamics. Data have become a core input for innovation. Other changes include more opportunities for versioning; an acceleration in innovation, more experimentation and collaboration; servitisation; and higher risk associated with these general purpose technologies. The digital transformation also has economy-wide effects in terms of business dynamics, market structures and distribution. In view of this transformation, changes to innovation policy are required in the digital age.

This paper addresses the question of the technological drivers of this phenomenon by studying the impact of the staggered diffusion of broadband internet in France during the 2000s. Our results confirm that broadband technology increases firm productivity and the relative demand for high-skill workers. Further, we show that broadband internet led firms to outsource some non-core occupations to service contractors, both in the low and high-skill segments. In both cases, we find that employment related to these occupations became increasingly concentrated in firms specializing in these activities, and was less likely to be performed in-house within firms specialized in other activities. As a result, after the arrival of broadband internet, establishments become increasingly homogeneous in their occupational composition. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that high-skill workers experience salary gains from bei...", "published_on": "2021-11-15", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/e3b226da-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/a68f1da38022a5fcda0cd7f80c61fc36.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/a68f1da38022a5fcda0cd7f80c61fc36.png", "topics": ["Outsourcing", "Labour economics", "Coefficient of determination", "Productivity", "Dependent and independent variables", "Monopsony", "Employment", "Fixed effects model", "Regression analysis", "Profit maximization", "Economy", "Supply (economics)", "Statistics", "Economics", "Offshoring", "Elasticity (economics)", "Profit (economics)", "Structural equation modeling", "Business", "Demand", "Business economics", "Market (economics)", "Dummy variable (statistics)", "Variance"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "labour", "economy, business and finance>economy", "labour>employment", "science and technology"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Working paper", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/e3b226da-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1016/j.labeco.2019.02.004", "title": "Delving into the demand side: Changes in workplace specialization and job polarization", "journal": "Labour Economics", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1162/rest_a_00366", "title": "Has ICT Polarized Skill Demand?

It\nfirst draws a picture of the challenges for innovation in the formal education sector, which suffers from a\npoor knowledge ecology: science is hardly linked to core teaching and administrative practices. It then\nturns to a common indicator of innovation: patents. In the case of education, patents typically cover\neducational tools. An analysis of education-related patents over the past 20 years shows a clear rise in the\nproduction of highly innovative educational technologies by businesses, typically building on advances in\ninformation and communication technology. While this increase in educational innovations may present\nnew opportunities for the formal education sector, the emerging tool industry currently targets the nonformal\neducation rather than the formal education system. We shortly discuss why business entrepreneurs\nmay be less interested in the market of formal education.", "published_on": "2012-10-03", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url":

Currently most of these countries benefit from preferential market access agreements and can export to OECD countries duty free and quota free. However, the trade schemes differ across OECD member countries; fragile states would benefit from their harmonisation. The current schemes also do not provide access for all goods \u2013 some agricultural products are excluded. OECD countries should open their markets to all goods from fragile states.

The multiple ionization events from DoE can directly break DNA double strands and initiate the activation of repair machinery through non-homologous end joining, an efficient, but error-prone process. When double strand breaks occur in DNA regions that transcribe critical genes, mutations generated by faulty repair may alter the function of these genes or cause chromosomal aberrations. These events alter the functions of many gene products and affect cell growth, cycling, and apoptosis. Cell proliferation is then promoted by escaping the regulatory control and forming hyperplasia in lung epithelial cells, leading eventually to lung cancer.

We show that a particularly striking feature of the productivity slowdown is not so much a lower productivity growth at the global frontier, but rather rising labour productivity at the global frontier coupled with an increasing labour productivity divergence between the global frontier and laggard (non-frontier) firms. This productivity divergence remains after controlling for differences in capital deepening and mark-up behaviour, suggesting that divergence in measured multi-factor productivity (MFP) may in fact reflect technological divergence in a broad sense. This divergence could plausibly reflect the potential for structural changes in the global economy \u2013 namely digitalisation, globalisation and the rising importance of tacit knowledge \u2013 to fuel rapid productivity gains at the global frontier.

However, since the information is primarily collected for use in the private sector typically with the aim of financial benchmarking, a number of steps need to be undertaken before the data can be used for economic analysis. The steps we apply closely follow suggestions by Kalemli-Ozcan, Sorensen, Villegas-Sanchez, Volosovych and Yesiltas (2015) and previous OECD experience (Gal, 2013; Ribeiro, Menghinello and Backer, 2010). 13 Three broad steps are: i) ensuring comparability of monetary variables across countries and over time (industry-level PPP conversion and deflation); ii) deriving new variables that will be used in the analysis (capital stock, productivity); and iii) keeping company accounts with valid and relevant information for our present purposes (filtering or cleaning). Finally, Orbis is a subsample of the universe of companies for most countries, retaining the larger and hence probably more productive firms. To mitigate problems arising from this \u2013 particularly the under-representation of small firms \u2013 we restrict our sample to firms with more than 20 employees on average over their observed lifespan.

The analysis finds that, compared to other (AI and non-AI) patents, they are more original and general, and tend to be broader in technological scope.

The volume is based on the proceedings of a conference co-organised by the OECD Economics Department and the World Bank on 24-25 March 2011, which brought together academics and practitioners from advanced, emerging-market and developing economies.

An important message that came out of the conference is that strong growth is not necessarily inclusive and that policy action is needed to make sure that pro-growth initiatives also foster inclusiveness.", "published_on": "2012-04-06", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264168305-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/4a3e8d88a6c583f44f4b85c3370bfeea.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/4a3e8d88a6c583f44f4b85c3370bfeea.png", "topics": ["Politics", "Subsidy", "Credit", "Income", "Informal economy", "Welfare", "Political economy", "Macroeconomics", "Labour economics", "Risk", "OECD", "Poverty reduction", "Investment", "Property", "Thai Rak Thai Party", "Economics", "Fiscal policy", "Investor", "Authoritarianism", "Education", "Clientelism", "Sustainability", "Power (social and political)", "Property rights (economics)", "Competition", "Policy", "Social exclusion", "World Bank", "Economy", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "Developing country", "Good governance", "Capitalism", "Innovation", "Employment", "Economic inequality", "Economic rent", "Thailand", "Bank", "Organization", "Poverty", "Market failure", "Finance", "Productivity", "Entrepreneurship", "Market (economics)", "Competition (economics)", "Institution", "Governance", "Economic growth", "Gross domestic product", "Rent-seeking", "Tariff", "Democracy", "Coalition", "Research and development", "Financial system", "Election", "Income distribution", "Wealth", "Colonialism", "Econometrics", "Populism", "Strategy", "Green growth", "Tax", "Daron Acemoglu", "Capital (economics)", "Technology", "Social protection", "Contract", "Value chain", "Regulation", "Manufacturing", "Business cycle", "Corruption", "Unemployment", "Transaction cost", "Regression analysis", "Law", "Violence", "Loan", "Economic restructuring", "Society", "Political science", "Financial deepening", "Renting", "Leadership", "Free market", "United States", "India", "Democratization", "Deregulation", "Welfare state", "Gini coefficient", "Labour Party (UK)", "System", "Interest", "Corporate governance", "Automated teller machine"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["science and technology>social sciences", "economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economy", "science and technology", "politics>government", "science and technology>social sciences>economics", "politics"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/9789264168305-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1017/cbo9780511559938.007", "title": "Learning to learn, localized learning and technological progress", "publisher": "Cambridge University Press"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264026865-en", "title": "Uses and Abuses of Governance Indicators", "journal": "Development Centre Studies", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264017948-en", "title": "Reviews of National Policies for Education: Denmark 2004", "journal": "Reviews of National Policies for Education", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.1787/eco_outlook-v2003-2-36-en", "title": "Fiscal Stance over the Cycle", "journal": "OECD Economic Outlook, Volume 2019 Issue 1", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1596/978-0-8213-7491-7", "title": "The Growth Report", "publisher": "The World Bank"}, {"doi": "10.7551/mitpress/9065.001.0001", "title": "Guardians of Finance", "publisher": "The MIT Press"}, {"doi": "10.1017/cbo9781139085052.004", "title": "Rent-seeking and Economic Development in Thailand", "publisher": "Cambridge University Press"}, {"doi": "10.1017/cbo9780511575839", "title": "Violence and Social Orders", "publisher": "Cambridge University Press"}, {"doi": "10.1257/aer.91.5.1369", "title": "The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation", "journal": "American Economic Review", "publisher": "American Economic Association"}, {"doi": "10.1162/003355302320935025", "title": "Reversal of Fortune: Geography and Institutions in the Making of the Modern World Income Distribution", "journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}, {"doi": "10.1093/wber/lhn020", "title": "Banking Services for Everyone?

The analysis combines unique harmonised data on business dynamics for 15 countries with a multi-dimensional measure of digital intensity that takes into account different facets of the digital transformation. Two key stylised facts emerge. First, digital intensive sectors \u2013 especially digital intensive services \u2013 are on average more dynamic than other sectors of the economy. Second, business dynamism has been declining in digital intensive sectors, and more so than in other sectors, especially after 2001.

Innovation uses scientific progress to meet the changing needs of society and is thus one of the keys to sustainable development. Promoting innovation is now a high priority in most OECD countries. However, the pursuit of this objective is often hampered by an inadequate understanding of the extent to which the mechanisms of innovation are being transformed by globalisation, the development of information and communications technologies and the expanding scientific knowledge base. Drawing on new empirical data, this book analyses the fundamental changes in the linkages between industry and the science system as well as in the nature of the competencies required for firms to innovate.

Sub Saharan African countries are not immune to the contestation of the way the sector has been managed to date, dominated as it was by a technological stability and bilateral institutional arrangements between public monopolies. Four factors have contributed to a radical change: the need for a greater efficiency of the networks; the possibility to introduce competition through deregulation; technical and organisational innovations; and the narrow base of public funds available for the sectoral development.

There is now a transition underway as commodity prices fall, and the key challenge for Peru is how to improve productivity and maintain this growth trajectory. Peru is a territorially diverse country and addressing these challenges will require policies that are designed for the specific needs of different cities and regions. The importance of regional policies is particularly important for the case of Peru. Within the OECD only four countries have a larger land mass. The physical geography of the country is shaped by a thin coastal region, the Andes and the Amazon forest in the interior. These different areas are not well connected and have vastly different levels of service provision and infrastructure. The report sets out how regional policies can be improved to address these challenges. This includes ensuring the preconditions (such as revenues, capabilities and coordinating mechanisms) are in place for decentralisation to work.

As these technologies transform the production and the distribution of goods and services, they will have far-reaching consequences for productivity, skills, income distribution, well-being and the environment.

While we suspect that public policy can play an important role in accelerating the development and diffusion of climate change mitigation and adaptation technologies, empirical evidence in this area remains scant.

The authors discuss options for policy initiatives that can foster technological innovation in the pursuit of faster and sustainable growth.\u00a0The various chapters highlight how the emergence of an integrated global market affects the impact of national innovation policy. What seemed like effective innovation strategies (e.g. policies designed to strengthen the R&amp;D capacity of domestic firms) are no longer sufficient for effective catch-up. The more open and global nature of innovation makes innovation policies more difficult to design and implement at the national scale alone. These challenges are further complicated by new phenomena, such as global value chains and th...", "published_on": "2009-11-20", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url":

The rules and practices that govern fiscal relations among different levels of government, such as their responsibilities for taxation, spending and debt management, have a bearing on economic efficiency and ultimately growth.

It presents a conceptual framework for understanding the main enabling conditions and diffusion channels of FDI-SME linkages and spillovers, and a set of diagnostic tools to assess the spillover potential. It also provides an assessment tool for policy and institutional frameworks enabling FDI-SME linkages.

Today, AI is transforming societies and economies. It promises to generate productivity gains, improve well-being and help address global challenges, such as climate change, resource scarcity and health crises. Yet, as AI applications are adopted around the world, their use can raise questions and challenges related to human values, fairness, human determination, privacy, safety and accountability, among others. This report helps build a shared understanding of AI in the present and near-term by mapping the AI technical, economic, use case and policy landscape and identifying major public policy considerations.

KI erm\u00f6glicht Produktivit\u00e4tssteigerungen, kann die Lebensqualit\u00e4t erh\u00f6hen und sogar bei der Bew\u00e4ltigung globaler Herausforderungen wie Klimawandel, Ressourcenknappheit und Gesundheitskrisen helfen. Mit der weltweiten Einf\u00fchrung von KI-Anwendungen wachsen aber auch die Bedenken, die ihre Nutzung aufwirft, u. a. in Bezug auf menschliche Werte und Fragen wie Fairness, menschliche Entscheidungsfreiheit, Datenschutz, Sicherheit und Haftung.

However, challenges abound: many parts of infrastructure systems in OECD countries are ageing rapidly, public finances are becoming increasingly tight and infrastructure financing is becoming more complex. This book assesses the future viability of current \"business models\" in five infrastructure sectors: electricity, water, rail freight, urban mass transit and road transport. It proposes policy recommendations that aim to enhance capacity to meet future infrastructure needs, including measures that could be taken by governments both collectively and individually to create more favourable institutional, policy and regulatory frameworks.", "published_on": "2007-08-17", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264031326-en", "pdf_url":

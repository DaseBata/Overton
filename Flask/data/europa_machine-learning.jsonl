The analyses follow from a collaboration between the Joint Research Centre\u2019s (JRCs) LUISA team, and the City of Amsterdam. The study provides insight in the spatial dynamics of Amsterdam\u2019s housing market, uncovering the driving factors behind the city\u2019s spiraling-up house prices, providing empirical support to a further development of an inclusive and accessible housing market for all. The analyses indicate that closer proximity to the city centre, older buildings, and companies as buyers, are the main determinants behind higher prices. Another main finding is that looking at asking prices, Amsterdam&#39;s middle income households would need to spend a higher share of their incomes on long-term rents, in comparison to middle class income households at country level. Furthermore, for Amsterdam&#39;s middle incomes, asking prices reflect private re...", "published_on": "2021-11-15", "added_on": "2021-11-23", "document_url": "https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/99fb3a7a-475a-11ec-91ac-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=99fb3a7a-475a-11ec-91ac-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/68e9fde03a56ef29d3fee2d9856df11f.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/68e9fde03a56ef29d3fee2d9856df11f.png", "topics": ["Correlation and dependence", "Affordable housing", "Data analysis", "Real estate appraisal", "Price"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>construction and property", "science and technology", "science and technology>mathematics", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>construction and property>real estate"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["Catalogue number KJ-NA-30883-EN-N", "10.2760/700246", "9789276433606", "ISSN 1831-9424"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1109/icmla.2016.0092", "title": "Hedonic Housing Theory \u2014 A Machine Learning Investigation", "publisher": "IEEE"}], "policy": [], "news": [], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "usage built upon  previous work on the suitability of machine  learning in the implementation of the hedonic  pricing theory Oladunni and Sharma,  2016, an XGBoost machine learning regression  model 6 has been fitted to explain how  the previously introduced set of 18 variables    6 XGBoost is an ensemble method that combines thepredictions of several non-linear decision tree estimators.Recently this has been dominating applied machinelearning and competitions for structured or tabulardata.

In particular, the model would have pointed early on to emerging vulnerabilities in all the euro area countries that registered severe recessions in the years after 2007.

The broad patterns of workplace transformation and of changing skill needs in today\u2019s jobs are, however, visible and give us some clues as to likely future developments. For example, findings from Cedefop\u2019s European skills and jobs survey show that 43% of EU workers have seen the technologies they use at work (machines, ICT systems) change in the past five years or since they started their current job; 47% experienced changes in their working methods and practices.

Although preclinical breast cancer research relies heavily on animal models, experimental approaches that more accurately recapitulate breast cancer pathogenesis are still missing.

To account for substantial modelling uncertainty, it estimates many vector error correction models (VECMs) using a wide set of short and long-run determinants and selects the most promising specifications based on in-sample and out-of-sample criteria. Our results highlight marked cross-country heterogeneity in the key drivers of housing investment which calls for country-specific housing market policies. A pseudo out-of-sample forecast exercise shows that our model averaging approach beats a battery of ambitious benchmark models, including BVARs, FAVARs, LASSO and Ridge regressions. This suggests that there is ample scope for model averaging tools in forecast exercises, notably as they also help to reduce model uncertainty and can be used to assess forecast uncertainty.",

The study begins by identifying XR affordances in the healthcare and education sectors, coupled with examples of European XR tools and applications. In addition, it identifies barriers associated with the wider adoption of XR in Europe. These relate to market conditions, technical limitations, research gaps and policymaking issues. Furthermore, the study analyses the European XR market, including: a) a presentation of the status quo and an exploration of future market potential; b) a vertical breakdown of the market by European players and their business models; and c) an investigation of technological standards in relation to XR.

We do this by applying a Bayesian hierarchical structure to the seminal model of technology diffusion. After motivating the new perspective and the choices of priors, we apply the resulting framework to a cross-continental data set for EU and OECD countries and different digital technologies adopted by either households/individuals or by businesses. The results illustrate that the Bayesian hierarchical structure may be used to assess and predict both the adoption process and the uncertainty surrounding the data, and is robust to the use of alternative priors. They point to heterogeneity across countries and across technologies, mostly in the timing of adoption and, although to a lesser extent, the steady-state adoption rate once technologies are fully diffused.

The estimation was done by downscaling, or disaggregating, census population reported at country-specific geometries (\u2018source geometry\u2019) to the Urban Atlas land use/land cover polygons (\u2018target geometry\u2019). The downscaling method can be described as a \u2018smart\u2019 areal interpolation which combined land use/land cover information from Urban Atlas, building densities from the European Settlement Map and census data.

We describe the monetary policy decisions from the ECB\u2019s perspective and against the background of its evolving monetary policy strategy and framework. We also highlight a number of the key critical issues that were the subject of debate. The second section contains a partial assessment. We first analyze the achievement of the price stability mandate and developments in the ECB\u2019s credibility. Next, we investigate the ECB\u2019s interest rate decisions through the lens of a simple empirical interest rate reaction function. This is appropriate until the ECB hits the zero-lower bound in 2013.

The report also notes that while existing literature is useful in understanding attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines, the unique circumstances of the pandemic limit the generalizability of these findings.

It is designed to support the formation of chemical categories and the application of read-across within the hazard and risk assessment of chemicals. Such a tool will be useful for scientific researchers, for end-users in industry, for regulatory authorities, and for the EU Chemicals Agency. Toxmatch was developed by Ideaconsult Ltd (Sofia, BG) under the terms of a JRC-ECB contract. It is a flexible user-friendly, computer-based open source application which is accessible via internet. It encodes and applies a range of different structural and descriptor based chemical similarity indices. The novelty of this software lies in its ability to calculate similarity measures that are tailored for specific activities/toxicities.

At the start of this study, it became clear that the data source for the initial METIS hydro power model, this is, ENTSO-E\u2019s Transparency Platform, was inaccurate in terms of envelope parameters: both the annual hydro power generation statistics and the installed capacities were not aligned with data reported by Eurostat or national Transmission System Operators (e.g. RTE and REE, the French and Spanish TSO, respectively).

Gerbens-Leenes (University of Twente, The Netherlands) addressed the water\nfootprint of electricity and heat.\nThe availability of fresh water of sufficient quality is an important issue on present policy\nagenda\u2019s, whereby the relation with energy security receives increasing attention. Today,\nfossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) are still the dominant energy source. In some countries,\nalso nuclear energy is important. In 2012, 70% of the global electricity generation came\nfrom thermo-electric power plants, with 11% generated in nuclear power plants. The\ngrowing demand for energy and the need to reduce the use of fossil fuels to mitigate\nglobal warming has stimulated the expansion of renewable energy, e.g. hydropower and\nwind and solar energy. Biomass is another renewable energy source, providing fuels such\nas bioethanol or biodiesel, and also electricity when used in a power plant. Although\nrenewables were often regarded as clean energy sources, there has been in the recent\nyears an increasing concern about their environmental sustainability. Such concerns\ninclude for example the large amount of water use for growing biomass.\nWater is essential to energy production. In the three stages of the energy production\nchain, the fuel supply stage, the construction stage and the operational stage, water is\nneeded. In the fuel supply stage, mining, processing and transport of fuels like coal, oil,\ngas and uranium require water. The growth of biomass (e.g. firewood) for energy\npurposes also requires water. Other energy sources \u2013 hydropower and solar, wind and\ngeothermal energy \u2013 do not have a fuel supply stage. In the construction stage, water is\nneeded for the mining and processing of materials, for example, for the materials for a\nhydropower dam or for a power plant. In the operational stage, water is needed for\nprocesses like the cooling of power plants, dust suppression (e.g. for coal) or flue gas\ndesulfurization. Also, there is water consumed through evaporation from the hydropower\nreservoirs or for the cooling of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) systems.\nA generally accepted indicator for water use is the Water Footprint (WF) that measures\nthe volume of freshwater used for a product over the full supply chain, showing water\nconsumption by source and polluted volumes by type of pollution. The blue WF measures\nconsumptive use of surface and groundwater; the green WF measures consumption of\nrainwater (most relevant in agriculture and forestry); the grey WF, not considered here,\nis an indicator of water pollution. The term \u2018consumptive WF\u2019 is used to refer to the sum\nof the blue and green WF.\nThe goal of the study reported here is to estimate the present-day and future water\nconsumption related to global electricity and heat generation and to understand\ndetermining factors, regional differences and risks posed by regional water scarcity. More\nspecifically, the study aims:\n- to quantify the consumptive WF of electricity and heat generation for different energy\nsources and technologies for the three main stages of the production chain, i.e. fuel\nsupply, construction and operation, per unit of gross energy produced and per unit of net\nenergy produced;\n- to assess the consumptive WF of electricity and heat generation per energy source per\nworld region, accounting for the different energy mixes used per region;\n- to compare, per country, the fuel production (in TJ/y) and the operational WF of\nelectricity and heat generation to the annual average monthly blue water scarcity in\norder to identify water-risk areas; and to estimate the consumptive WF in the year 2035.\nWe consider the most important energy sources: coal, lignite, natural gas, shale gas,\nconventional and unconventional oil, uranium, biomass, wind, solar, geothermal and\nhydropower. The study is based on data from literature on water consumption per unit of\nenergy for different energy sources, combined with information on electricity and heat\nproduction per energy source per country. The study identifies criticalities associated with\nwater scarcity."}]}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "domains of Agriculture and Water Sciences.

Our analysis highlights an overall increasing trend for network homogeneity, whereby core banks have a tendency to distribute their market exposures more equally across their partners.",

An unrestricted mixed data sampling strategy within a Bayesian quantile regression is used to accommodate a large mixed frequency dataset when nowcasting; we use a shrinkage prior to avoid parameter proliferation in what becomes a large dimensional quantile regression. In an application to euro area GDP growth, using over 400 mixed frequency indicators, we find that the quantile regression approach does not produce as accurate density nowcasts overall as the density combination approach of Mazzi et al.

Such applications are prone to combined impact and abrasion in presence of particles. This might result in dual occurrence or overlap in wear mechanisms. Investigations on abrasion resistance have already been conducted in previous RFCS projects. However, the existing abrasion studies mostly focus on production related challenges of tool steels. Though priority was given to abrasion, the attention was mainly devoted to two body abrasive wear, whereas IMMARS tends to focus on three body impact abrasion. In addition, the current optimisation of abrasion resistance via hardness properties is not based on the understanding of the underlying failure mechanisms, but merely based on experience. The IMMARS project therefore aims to provide a methodological approach for a holistic multi-scale description of abrasion resistance.

First, we describe how asset encumbrance has evolved in euro area banks, focusing on country and business model aggregates.

Specifically, the study uses innovative data from Index Facebook&#39;s Social Connectedness to explain bilateral remittance flows. This data source is positively associated with remittance flows and the findings are robust and statistically significant. These findings have two key implications.

It documents how communication has become a monetary policy tool in itself; one example of this being forward guidance, given its impact on inflation expectations, economic behaviour and inflation. The paper explains why and how consistent, clear and effective communication to expert and non-expert audiences is essential in an environment of an ever-increasing need by central banks to reach these audiences.

Changing weather conditions affect the operation of the European power systems. The output of renewable energy sources fluctuates depending on the availability of wind, cloud cover, or water levels in reservoirs, while the output of dispatchable generators, such as gas turbines, must be adapted accordingly to ensure that supply and demand are balanced at all times.

An issue discussed in the first section is the measurement of job requirements, i.e. a demand side variable, that some authors compute using surveys of individuals, which typically collect information on the supply side (educational attainment, foundation skills). Individuals, however, do not often have a reliable view of job requirements, and may actually have an incentive to inflate them. Another issue is whether skill shortages stated by employers reflect the lack of suitable candidates among job seekers or are due instead to the wage and working conditions being offered.",

The changes in the use of the service cannot be explained solely by changes in the potential and demand, but also by their spatial relationship. When dealing with ecosystem services the spatial component is a key driver that needs to be integrated within the accounting framework for a consistent assessment. The spatial relationship between potential and demand is different for each service. Crop pollination requires the spatial overlap between potential and demand, whereas proximity is the key spatial feature for outdoor recreation. As shown by the two examples, ecosystem service accounts significantly differ depending on the service being assessed, both conceptually and methodologically. Hence, further examples of ecosystem service accounting are needed to produce accounting tables for a representative number of service.

The endocrine system regulates\nthe body's development, growth, reproduction, metabolism, immunity and behaviour. The\nhormones actions on the body are precisely controlled, regarding both dose and timing, with\nspecific windows of susceptibility during development. Disruption of the endocrine system can\naffect health, even with life-long effects. Recently, criteria for the determination of endocrine\ndisrupting properties have been adopted, to be used for the regulation of pesticides and biocides.\nThese criteria include the identification of a (endocrine) mode of action.

Statins are commonly used to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to treat\npatients with hypercholesterolaemia since they control the level of plasma total and LDLcholesterol\nby inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme of the mevalonate\npathway for the cholesterol biosynthesis. The use of these drugs is associated with adverse\neffects due to their interaction with off-targets in liver, muscle and brain. In particular, they can\ncause statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and de novo type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\nHowever, the molecular targets behind the pathophysiology of these side effects still wait to be\nclarified. Aim of the study. We aim at assessing potential off-target proteins responsible for the\nabove-mentioned adverse effects of statins, through a combination of in silico plus in vitro\napproaches. Studi design. In silico phase: taking advantage of the SPILLO-PBSS in silico tool, we\nwill identify potential off-target proteins, based on the ability of statins to interact with their\northosteric site. In vitro phase: using appropriate in vitro cell-based systems, including human\nHepG2 cells, we will validate the findings obtained from the in silico approach, by means of\nenzymatic activity assay, modulation of gene and protein expression and related intra-cellular\nsignalling pathways, as well as metabolic changes. Potential outcomes. The identification of\nspecific off-target proteins for statins may help to define a personalized therapeutical approach\nfor patients, preventing the occurrence of statin-related adverse effects.\nKeywords: Statins, off-target protein, in silico, in vitro, adverse effects."}, {"person": "M.

Marinovich\nUniversit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, Italy.\nThis study consisted of a safety assessment of two shampoos, a common one and a so-called\ngreen one. The choice to assess two different shampoos depends on the recent trend of\nconsidering any product bearing the words \"green\" as automatically safer than the others. The\nword green has become a powerful concept in cosmetics, but with a much less certain\ndefinition. A cosmetic safety assessment is been conducted following the protocols. After\ncalculating SED and MoS values, a TTC approach has been evaluated using COSMOS TTC\nworkflow. The Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) is a pragmatic risk assessment based\napproach that has gained regulatory acceptance for food and has been adapted to address\ncosmetic ingredient safety. MoS was evaluated only for those ingredients that have a NOAEL,\nresulting for all of them way more 100. Unfortunately, it was not possible to apply the TTC for\nsome ingredients, due to the lack of a precise SMILE. It was missing for 6/24 (25%) and 6/14\n(43%) ingredients of common and green shampoo, respectively. Based on TTC approach, the\nremaining ones do not need any other evaluation because they have a negligible concern with\nthe exception of sodium benzoate and potassium benzoate. Both shampoos were assessed safe\nand the TTC approach proved to be valid for their safety assessment, especially for the common\nshampoo. Its limitation depends, among other things, on the absence of SMILE, above all\nabsence for the ingredients of the green shampoo due to the presence of many oils.\nKeywords: Safety assessment; cosmetic; hair; green products."}, {"person": "Pavel Babica", "affiliation": "Masaryk University", "snippet": "Poster 029\nLucie \u010ctver\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1\nEffects of phthalates on liver homeostasis and tumor promotion\nLucie \u010ctver\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1, Pavel Babica, Jan Ra\u0161ka, Iva Sovadinov\u00e1\nRECETOX, Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.\nEsters of phthalate acid (phthalates) are used as major plasticizers, therefore humans are\nexposed to phthalates leaking from plastics from the environment and from cosmetics or food\non a daily basis. Although phthalates are showing low acute toxicity, studies indicated other\nnegative effects after chronic exposure even at low concentrations/doses. They can induce a\nvariety of effects at the cellular and tissue level, including alterations of biochemical and\nsignalling pathways by epigenetic mechanisms at non-cytotoxic doses of chemicals, which are\nalso known to result in changes of cell physiology, gene expression and cell behaviour that\ncontribute to adverse effects such as developmental and reproductive toxicity, inflammatory\ndiseases or cancer. Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) represents a key\nmechanism involved in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and it is a central regulator of\ncell signalling and gene expression. Dysregulation of GJIC has been linked to various adverse\nhealth effects including tumor promotion. The effects of phthalates were investigated in a rat\nliver progenitor / liver epithelial cell line WB-F344 characterized by functional GJIC. Our results\nshowed that modulation of GJIC by phthalates depends on the structure and molecular weight\nof the tested chemicals. The highest level of GJIC inhibition was observed after exposures to\nphthalic acid diesters with side chains made by 4-6 carbons. GJIC was affected even after short\nexposure times (<10 minutes), which implies, that apart from mechanisms of genomic signalling\nthrough nuclear receptors, the effects of phthalates can be mediated also through rapid\nmechanisms of non-genomic signalling.\nKeywords: Phthalates, liver toxicity, oval cells, in vitro, GJIC."}, {"person": "Annamaria Buschini", "affiliation": "University of Parma", "snippet": "Poster 074\nSerena Montalbano\nA biotechnological approach for the development of new antifungal compounds to protect\nthe environment and the human health\nSerena Montalbano 1 , Franco Bisceglie 1 , Mauro Carcelli 1 , Elisabetta Ceretti 2 , Francesca Degola 1 ,\nDonatella Feretti 2 , Giorgio Pelosi 1 , Marianna Pioli 1 , Francesco Maria Restivo 1 , Dominga\nRogolino 1 , Giorgio Spadola 1 , Claudia Zani 2 , Annamaria Buschini 1"}]}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "of variability in the response of human hearts topharmacological therapy, and their importance in assessing safety and efficacy during drugdevelopment.

The d-SRI increases on average several years before the onset of systemic financial crises, and its early warning properties for euro area countries are superior to those of the total credit-to-GDP gap. In addition, the level of the d-SRI around the start of financial crises is highly correlated with measures of subsequent crisis severity, such as GDP declines. Model estimates suggest that the d-SRI has significant predictive power for large declines in real GDP growth three to four years down the line, as it precedes shifts in the entire distribution of future real GDP growth and especially of its left tail. The d-SRI therefore provides useful information about both the probability and the likely cost of systemic financial crises many years in advance.

Since these sectors are unevenly spread across countries and regions, the labor impact will also be unevenly spread with the highest impact in Southern Germany and Northern Italy.

This has led in the past years to a proliferation of different definitions and identification methodologies. We survey the most prominent definitions, discussing advantages and limitations of each. We also undertake a comparison of methodologies on a common dataset for euro area firms from 2004-2019, with the exercise revealing limited overlap and low comparability in the firms identified by several prominent studies. In response, we introduce a formalisation of zombie- classifications which helps to make order in the growing number of variations and identification methodologies.

Impact investments are executed only when a positive financial return can be achieved alongside a measurable positive impact on an individual or societal level.

Most impact investment funds invest in areas such as healthcare, education or employment and thus improve the situation of the target group. At the same time, however, there is no explicit human rights perspective integrated into the investment process yet.

To understand the reasons for firms\u2019 decision to invest in their workforce, we examine transition patterns and employ dynamic panel data estimation.

Thanks to this commitment, Europe today has a wealth of organisations specialising in adult and continuing education. The sector has grown in importance, both as an increasingly significant player in the economy and in view of its capacity to respond to the demand for learning by the knowledge economy.

In recent years, e-commerce has been expanding rapidly as consumers have become increasingly confident in ordering goods and services online. The number of businesses engaged in business to consumer (B2C) e-commerce is constantly growing. Between 2018 and 2020, online retail sales, a subset of the B2C total, rose by 41% in major economies, compared to less than a 1% rise in total retail sales. The increase was fuelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, as consumers ordered online during lockdowns and to avoid frequenting shops. During the pandemic, the online environment also became a more popular target for illicit trade. Cyber law enforcement reported increasing volumes of various e-crimes, including offerings of illicit goods, among them fake and substandard medicines, test kits and other COVID-19-related goods.

The review examines conceptual questions on how to measure intergenerational mobility, empirical evidence on both descriptive and causal questions, and the data requirements that mobility research faces. The extent of income mobility varies substantially between countries, and appears negatively correlated with income inequality both across and within countries. For this reason, there is particular interest on mobility trends over time in those countries where income inequality has recently been increasing. However, the evidence for mobility trends in more recent cohorts is as yet less conclusive. Descriptive associations can only be suggestive of causal links, and the report also reviews evidence from more targeted research designs on the importance of (i) neighbourhoods and schools, (ii)

Over the last few years a vast amount of information on the (meta)genomes of microorganisms has been generated. The potential exploitation of these discoveries in environmental biotechnology is enormous but requires profound knowledge of the functioning of microbial cells as complex networks of interacting metabolites, which is the aim of metabolomic studies.

However, forests are among the most complex systems and their interaction with the ongoing climate change \u2013 and the multifaceted chain of potential cascading consequences for European biodiversity, environment, society and economy \u2013 is not yet well understood. The JRC PESETA project series proposes a consistent multi-sectoral assessment of the impacts of climate change in Europe. Within the PESETA II project, a robust methodology is introduced for modelling the habitat suitability of forest tree species (2071-2100 time horizon). Abies alba (the silver fir) is selected as a case study: a main European tree species often distributed in bioclimatically complex areas, spanning over various forest types and with multiple populations adapted to different conditions. The modular modelling architecture is based on relative distance similarity (RDS) estimates which link field observations with bioclima...", "published_on": "2018-03-07", "added_on": "2020-09-20", "document_url": "https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/5cc096d5-0e05-11e7-8a35-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=5cc096d5-0e05-11e7-8a35-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/430b3e2cf7f10515a2414ccd1adca793.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/430b3e2cf7f10515a2414ccd1adca793.png", "topics": ["Assisted colonization", "Tree", "Median", "Uncertainty", "Probability distribution", "Fir", "Map", "General circulation model", "Time", "Resampling (statistics)", "Outlier", "Ecological resilience", "Climate change mitigation", "Invasive species", "Ecological niche", "Effects of global warming", "Information", "Green building", "Natural environment", "Wildfire", "Climate", "Habitat", "Artificial neural network", "Forest", "Adaptation", "Unsupervised learning", "Digital elevation model", "Dependent and independent variables", "Sampling (statistics)", "Biodiversity", "Ecology", "Species", "Robust statistics", "Disturbance (ecology)", "Global warming", "Species distribution", "Europe", "Sustainability", "Soil", "Habitat fragmentation", "Biological dispersal", "Probability", "Measurement", "Nature", "Abies alba", "Vegetation", "Human impact on the environment", "Topography", "Observation", "European Union", "Competition", "Solar irradiance", "Temperature", "Data", "Kernel density estimation", "Variance", "Evolution", "Top-down and bottom-up design", "Forestry", "Human migration", "Remote sensing", "Precipitation", "Sensitivity and specificity", "Climate model", "Statistics", "Landscape", "Space", "Taiga", "Conservation biology", "Semantics", "Special Report on Emissions Scenarios", "Soil consolidation", "Greenhouse gas", "Taxonomy (biology)", "Mutualism (biology)", "Parameter", "Extrapolation", "Earth sciences", "Assumption", "Ecosystem", "Distance"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["environment>natural resources>land resources", "science and technology>natural science", "environment", "science and technology>natural science>biology", "environment>natural resources>land resources>forests", "environment>natural resources", "science and technology"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["KJ-04-17-260-EN-E", "KJ-04-17-260-EN-N", "10.2760/175227", "10.2760/296501", "9789279667046", "9789279741784"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1002/1522-2624(200102)164:1<35::aid-jpln35>3.0.co;2-m", "title": "Effects of growing roots of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) on rhizosphere soil solution chemistry", "journal": "Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1890/es13-00182.1", "title": "Viewing forests through the lens of complex systems science", "journal": "Ecosphere", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.2791/7409", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2788/84823", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2903/sp.efsa.2014.en-434", "title": "Supporting EFSA assessment of the EU environmental suitability for exotic forestry pests: Final Report", "journal": "EFSA Supporting Publications", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1111/1365-2745.12337", "title": "Forest resilience and tipping points at different spatio-temporal scales: approaches and challenges", "journal": "Journal of Ecology", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.foreco.2010.10.038", "title": "Climate change and nature conservation in Central European forests: A review of consequences, concepts and challenges", "journal": "Forest Ecology and Management", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1051/forest:2003077", "title": "Effects of tree species on understory vegetation and environmental conditions in temperate forests", "journal": "Annals of Forest Science", "publisher": "EDP Sciences"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.01.018", "title": "What does ecological modelling model?

However, due to the Waste Framework Directive and the Circular Economy Action Plan, they share the common goal of increasing recycling. The first step towards increasing the recycling of valuable materials (e.g. glass, plastic, metal, paper) is to implement a successful separate waste collection (SWC) system. Citizens\u2019 behaviour plays a key role in separate collection. Thus, it is important to understand the main behavioural factors of waste sorting and how they can be encouraged. This study presents the main findings of a literature review focused on identifying and classifying the factors underlying SWC. Along with the literature review, various stakeholders participated in a survey to identify the factors influencing SWC. We discuss factors affecting whether people are motivated, capable and perceive the right opportunities to sort their waste. These factors allow for a much more detailed understanding of consumer waste sorting than ...", "published_on": "2022-12-05", "added_on": "2022-12-13", "document_url": "https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b6dfba07-751d-11ed-9887-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=b6dfba07-751d-11ed-9887-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/c43af773a5972c21ab0c2ea96b31f5a8.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/c43af773a5972c21ab0c2ea96b31f5a8.png", "topics": ["Value (ethics and social sciences)", "Policy", "Circular economy", "Education", "Waste", "Economics", "Effect size", "Theory of planned behavior", "Consumer behaviour", "Communication", "Information", "Social norm", "Incentive", "Intention", "Motivation", "Attitude (psychology)", "Waste management", "Recycling", "Behavior", "Packaging and labeling", "Utility", "Pay as you throw", "Meta-analysis", "Self-concept", "Branches of science", "Psychological concepts", "Cognitive science", "Incineration", "Infrastructure", "Municipal solid waste", "Cognition", "European Union", "Persuasion", "Expert", "Externality", "QR code", "Psychology", "Concepts in metaphysics", "Research", "Daniel Kahneman", "Perception", "Thinking, Fast and Slow", "Goal", "Reason", "Cost\u2013benefit analysis", "Nudge theory", "Landfill", "Tax", "Belief", "Abstract (summary)", "Feedback", "Plastic", "Google Scholar"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["science and technology>social sciences", "science and technology", "environment", "education", "science and technology>social sciences>psychology", "science and technology>social sciences>economics"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["Catalogue number KJ-NA-31-310-EN-C", "Catalogue number KJ-NA-31-310-EN-N", "10.2760/665482", "10.2760/77931", "9789276590071", "9789276590088", "ISSN 1018-5593", "ISSN 1831-9424"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.01.032", "title": "Waste minimization by households \u2013 A unique informational strategy in the Netherlands", "journal": "Resources, Conservation and Recycling", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.jesp.2013.09.010", "title": "A green paradox: Validating green choices has ironic effects on behavior, cognition, and perception", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Social Psychology", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1177/00139169921972272", "title": "The Impact of Norms and Assumed Consequences on Recycling Behavior", "journal": "Environment & Behavior", "publisher": "SAGE Publications"}, {"doi": "10.1177/0734242x13476746", "title": "Recycling behaviour of householders living in multicultural urban area: a case study of J\u00e4rva, Stockholm, Sweden", "journal": "Waste Management & Research", "publisher": "SAGE Publications"}, {"doi": "10.1177/0013916503260892", "title": "Behavioral Determinants of Household Recycling Participation", "journal": "Environment & Behavior", "publisher": "SAGE Publications"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.03.011", "title": "Psychological strategies to promote household recycling.

The main trends in provisioning, regulating and maintenance, and cultural ecosystem services were assessed using a set of 30 indicators assorted according to the CICES classification. More crops for food, feed and energy were produced in the EU on less arable land. More organic food was grown. Textile crop production and the total number of grazing livestock decreased. Water use relative to water availability remained stable. Timber removals increased but so, too, did the total timber stock. There was an increase in net ecosystem productivity (growing biomass).

According to the LUISA forecasts, the urban proportion will continue to increase up to 2030; subsequently slow down, and reach a relatively steady state by 2050. - In 2010, 65% of the EU population were living in Functional Urban Areas (FUA, the city and its commuting zone).

To do so, we use creditregistry data from Germany and Portugal together with the European Central Bank\u2019s policy-rate cuts in mid-2014. The pass-through of the rate cuts to banks\u2019 funding costs differs across the euro-area currency union because deposit rates vary in their distance to the zero lower bound (ZLB). When the distance is shorter, banks\u2019 financing constraints matter less for the supply of credit and there is more risk taking. To rationalize these findings, we provide a simple model of an augmented bank balance-sheet channel where in addition to costly external financing, there is screening of borrowers and a ZLB on retail deposit rates. An impaired pass-through of monetary policy to banks\u2019 funding costs reduces their ability to lever up and weakens their lending standards.", "published_on": "2022-11-22", "added_on": "2022-12-12", "document_url": "https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3ceb231c-6b03-11ed-b14f-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=3ceb231c-6b03-11ed-b14f-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/2e9e3c194e3c87f7331d1ae168571f89.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/2e9e3c194e3c87f7331d1ae168571f89.png", "topics": ["Economy", "Financial services", "Interbank lending market", "Debt", "Fiscal multiplier", "Credit rationing", "Greek government-debt crisis", "Macroeconomics", "Risk", "Central bank", "Equity (finance)", "Sampling (statistics)", "Balance sheet", "European troika", "Deutsche Bundesbank", "Interest", "Money", "Bond (finance)", "Bank", "Monetary policy", "European Central Bank", "Loan", "Credit", "Interest rate", "Finance", "Euro", "Government bond", "Eurozone", "Fixed effects model", "Statistics", "Portugal", "Economics", "Regression analysis", "Likelihood function", "Banking", "Government debt", "Currency", "Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008", "Security (finance)", "Monetary transmission mechanism", "Investment", "Deposit account", "Quantile", "Leverage (finance)", "Investor", "Standard error", "Real economy", "Dummy variable (statistics)", "Tobin's q"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>financial and business service", "economy, business and finance>economy", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics>interest rate", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>financial and business service>banking", "science and technology>mathematics", "science and technology"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["Catalogue number QB-AR-22-110-EN-N", "10.2866/69743", "9789289953931", "ISSN 1725-2806"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2307/2556100", "title": "An Adverse-Selection Model of Bank Asset and Liability Management with Implications for the Transmission of Monetary Policy", "journal": "The RAND Journal of Economics", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2021.06.032", "title": "Is there a zero lower bound?

We find that common global uncertainty plays a primary role in explaining the volatility of inflation, interest rates and stock prices, although to a varying extent over time. Region-specific uncertainty drives most of the exchange rate volatility for all Euro Area countries and for countries in North-America and Oceania. All uncertainty estimates (global, regional, country-specific and idiosyncratic) play a non-negligible role for real economic activity, credit and money for most countries.

For several ECB communication events, Twitter constitutes primarily a channel to relay information: tweets become more factual and the views expressed more moderate and homogeneous. Other communication events, such as former President Draghi\u2019s \u201cWhatever it takes\u201d statement, trigger persistent traffic and a divergence in views. Also, ECB-related tweets are more likely to get retweeted or liked if they express stronger or more subjective views. Thus, Twitter also serves as a platform for controversial discussions.

We present empirical evidence demonstrating that higher trust in public insurance systems reduces net liquid wealth while higher trust in communal insurance increases it.

This roadmap is communicated in the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (CSS) and relates to the broader EU sustainability agenda underpinned by the European Green Deal. A critical question for policy makers is how to monitor the progress towards these sustainability goals.

These networks have evolved over time, and have been launched in successive generations. The fifth generation of telecommunication networks will operate at frequencies that were not commonly used in previous generations, changing the exposure of wildlife to these waves. This report reviews the literature on the exposure of vertebrates, invertebrates and plants to radio-frequency electromagnetic fields in anticipation of this change. The review shows that dielectric heating can occur at all considered frequencies (0.4-300 GHz) and for all studied organisms. Summarising and discussing the results of a series of studies of radio-frequency electromagnetic field exposure of wildlife, the review shows that several studies into the effects of radio-frequency electromagnetic field exposure on invertebrates and plants in the frequency bands considered demonstrate experimental shortcomings.

This will result in the reduction of fertilizer use by at least 20%. To reach\nthis goal, in 2022 the European Commission will develop with Member States an Integrated Nutrient\nManagement Action Plan (INMAP), to better manage nitrogen throughout its life cycle. The JRC situated\nin Ispra collects methods and approaches to be included into the INMAP. In this context Bruna Grizzetti\n(JRC Ispra) reached out to the Co-Chairs of the Expert-Panel on Nitrogen Budgets of the Task Force\non Reactive Nitrogen (operating under CLRTAP), Wilfried Winiwarter (IIASA) and Markus Geupel (UBA).\nThe Expert Panel Co-Chairs agreed, to summarize the methodological approach of a \u201cGuidance\ndocument on national nitrogen budgets\u201d, an excellent tool to inventory all relevant nitrogen flows within\ndifferent segments of a national economy and its environmental pools, also considering cross- border\ntransport.

In 2014, some 26,000 people died and more than 203,500 were seriously injured on the roads of Europe, i.e. the equivalent of a medium town. However, although there are variations between Member States, road fatalities have been falling throughout the EU. Over the last 20 years, most Member States have achieved an overall reduction, some more than 50%. During this period, research on road safety and accident prevention has predominantly focused on protecting car occupants, with significant results. However, at the same time the number of fatalities and injuries among other categories of road users has not fallen to the same extent, indeed, in some cases, they have risen. The \u201cVulnerable Road Users\u201d (VRUs) in particular are a priority and represent a real challenge for researchers working on road safety and accident prevention.

To effectively tackle the complex (and multifaceted) issue of loneliness, a clear understanding of the phenomenon and its main drivers is needed. Over years of scientific research on loneliness, many potential risk factors have emerged and been tested empirically. Given the very large number of studies available in the literature, this narrative review provides a concise summary for each main potential risk factor for loneliness, with an emphasis on recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews of the literature as well as longitudinal studies from Europe and North America, covering the whole age range of the population where possible. The review focuses on both individual and societal factors, organising individual factors in order from distal to more proximal ones.

In this report, an evaluation around the most appropriate reporting unit for an urban ecosystems assessment is carried out, comparing Functional Urban Areas (FUA) and Local Administrative Units (LAU). Furthermore, UGI are assessed from a multi-scale perspective. The status and scenarios of UGI in European urbanised areas is first analysed measuring the urban green areas and the tree canopy cover. Secondly, the contribution of UGI to the overall European Green Infrastructure (EU-GI) is quantified, evaluating the respective role of FUA and LAU. Finally, the effect of urban characteristics on biotic homogenization is analysed exploring how urbanised areas impact on avian population and communities in French cities.

However, difficulties (particularly financial ones) for existing or aspiring HGEs in Europe to maintain or achieve high growth can lead to potential economic gains being unrealised or to Europe losing jobs, taxable revenues, know-how and innovation by such enterprises moving to countries where raising finance is easier, and other framework conditions more favourable. These difficulties appear particularly acute in equity-financing for the scale-up phase of such enterprises.

The analysis covers key areas of concern for external policy related to modern slavery within the domains of trade, development, and foreign policy. It further provides an overarching framework of considerations and approaches for the European Union in designing, implementing, and evaluating policy and programming related to modern slavery.",

In addition, biofuels and bioenergy from forest materials must comply with requirements which mirror the principles contained in the EU Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation. The sustainability criteria also include requirements to ensure high conversion efficiency of biomass into energy, the efficient use of limited resources and to avoid negative impacts on other (competitive) uses. The EU sustainability criteria are extended to cover solid biomass and biogas used in large heat and power plants (above 20 MW fuel capacity) and delivers at least 80% fewer GHG emission compared to

The Handbook is structured along these identified types. Each chapter consists of a theoretical part about the respective type of anti-corruption approach and is illustrated by corresponding case studies. To ensure transferability, analysis of the case studies focuses on implementation mechanisms, the estimated costs of such a practice, and its outcomes and limitations.

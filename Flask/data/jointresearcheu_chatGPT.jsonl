The proceedings are organised following the oral session schedule with all posters also clustered by topics to better navigate through the sea of knowledge they lay down. A notable development of BiDS'23 is related to artificial intelligence that is now infusing practically in all domains, notably on its use for monitoring and predicting (foresight), for more efficient and effective generation of insights, and for its integration within platform ecosystem and services. Recent European initiatives such as Destination Earth (DestinE) and Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) are also permeating into many presentations that contribute to the evolution of these initiativ...", "published_on": "2023-10-31", "added_on": "2023-11-08", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC135493", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC135493/JRC135493_01.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/75feb30e7e2e4645f9e3a659cf863c64.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/75feb30e7e2e4645f9e3a659cf863c64.png", "topics": ["Super-resolution imaging", "Hydrological model", "Training, validation, and test data sets", "Weather forecasting", "Meteorology", "Hydrology", "Particulates", "Air pollution", "Time series", "Dependent and independent variables", "Technology", "Earth sciences", "Computer vision", "ECMWF re-analysis", "Atmospheric reanalysis", "Regression analysis", "Climate", "European Union", "Drought", "Ground truth", "Climate change", "Wildfire", "Information", "Groundwater", "Satellite imagery", "Weather", "Data", "Artificial intelligence", "Forecasting", "Remote sensing", "Big data", "Image segmentation", "Cross-validation (statistics)", "Simulation", "Aerosol", "Eruption column", "Prediction", "Deep learning", "Convolutional neural network", "European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts", "Long short-term memory", "Machine learning", "Atmospheric dispersion modeling", "Drainage basin", "Evapotranspiration", "Cloud computing", "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", "Normalized difference vegetation index", "Copernicus Programme", "Microservices", "CNES", "Waste management", "Synthetic-aperture radar", "Root-mean-square deviation", "Atmosphere of Earth", "Image resolution", "Groundwater recharge", "Correlation", "Methodology", "Statistical classification", "Satellite", "Multispectral imaging", "Sustainability", "Data pre-processing", "Multiclass classification", "Artificial neural network", "Water", "Creative Commons license", "European Space Agency", "Quantile", "Fault tolerance", "Precipitation", "German Aerospace Center", "Science", "System", "Snow", "Earth observation satellite", "Flood", "Learning", "Solar irradiance", "Sentinel-2", "Open science", "Surrogate model", "Hackathon", "Weather satellite", "Geographic information system", "Workflow", "Sustainable Development Goals", "Water resources", "Surface runoff", "Waste", "Statistics", "Parameter", "Biodiversity", "Discharge (hydrology)", "RGB color model"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "weather", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology", "science and technology", "environment", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology>software"], "source_tags": ["Agriculture and food security", "Environment and climate change", "Information society"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/46796", "9789268086964", "JRC135493", "OP KJ-05-23-390-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1145/3317640.3317648", "title": "Hot Spot Processing System On-Board Based on Multi-spectral Remote Sensing Images", "publisher": "ACM"}, {"doi": "10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20302", "title": "Automated Herbarium Specimen Identification using Deep Learning", "journal": "Biodiversity Information Science and Standards", "publisher": "Pensoft Publishers"}, {"doi": "10.3390/su14074078", "title": "How Networks of Citizen Observatories Can Increase the Quality and Quantity of Citizen-Science-Generated Data Used to Monitor SDG Indicators", "journal": "Sustainability", "publisher": "MDPI AG"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2017.06.031", "title": "Google Earth Engine: Planetary-scale geospatial analysis for everyone", "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.dsp.2017.10.011", "title": "Methods for interpreting and understanding deep neural networks", "journal": "Digital Signal Processing", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1175/bams-d-18-0195.1", "title": "Making the Black Box More Transparent: Understanding the Physical Implications of Machine Learning", "journal": "Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society", "publisher": "American Meteorological Society"}, {"doi": "10.3390/rs13061125", "title": "The openEO API\u2013Harmonising the Use of Earth Observation Cloud Services Using Virtual Data Cube Functionalities", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "publisher": "MDPI AG"}, {"doi": "10.3233/isu-170824", "title": "Cloudy, increasingly FAIR;

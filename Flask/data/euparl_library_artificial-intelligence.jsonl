It alerts to the dangers of online censorship and limitations to online freedom of speech in third countries. In this respect, the EP calls for the effective implementation of the EU human rights guidelines on freedom of expression online and offline. Governmental interference can lead to intentional leaks or deletion of undesirable information, usually under the guise of anti-terrorist or emergency measures. Such interference mainly affects NGOs and human rights defenders who depend on the internet for communication and funding. Another argument presented is the online privatisation of the rule of law, where technology firms determine the scope of freedom of expression through censorship and adjusted terms and conditions of use, often presented to the user as a fait accompli. The EP warns of the dangers posed by artificial intelligence (AI), robotisation of weaponry and dual use of technology. With the ascendance of drone technology and AI, advanced unmanned hardware could become an affordable tool for targeted oppression and violence. Major military spenders, such as Russia, China and the US are already competing in the development of autonomous offensive machinery. Warnings of a third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and the atom bomb, have been made by a group of international experts led by entrepreneur Elon Musk, who called upon the UN to establish an international regulatory framework for this emerging industry. The EP has staunchly supported a ban on lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS).

The debate has been driven by concerns that US industry, notably through venture capital flows \u2013 US$19 billion in 2018 alone \u2013 could be helping advance the development of Chinese indigenous cutting-edge technologies that have military applications and could be used at the expense of US capabilities. This debate can be traced back at least as far as the 115th US Congress (2017-2018), which discussed and passed the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) of 2018, expanding the jurisdiction of the inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). CFIUS carries out case-by-case reviews of covered foreign direct investment transactions at the US Treasury Department. With FIRRMA, however, Congress stopped short of creating what is often referred to as a 'reverse CFIUS' jurisdiction for US outbound investment. Rather, Congress enhanced the protection of US high-end technologies, including under the Export Control Reform Act (ECRA) of 2018 and the Export Controls Act of 2018, by imposing stronger restrictions on the transfer to foreign persons of concern of certain US key 'emerging and foundational technologies' deemed critical to US national security. The Bureau of Industry and Security at the Department of Commerce enforces US export controls, including recent controls on advanced computing and semiconductor manufacturing items that have affected firms and policy in Japan and the Netherlands. https://chinaus-icas.org/research/congress-hearing-notes-house-financial-services-committee-combatting-the-economic-threat-from-china-feb-7-2023/https://www.aei.org/articles/out-of-bounds-investments-how-some-american-investors-are-helping-the-chinese-military/https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/venture-capital-flows-between-us-china-surpass-direct-investment.htmlhttps://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/What-is-MCF-One-Pager.pdfhttps://www.lw.com/en/insights/2018/04/status-CFIUS-reform-legislationhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5515/titleshttps://home.treasury.gov/system/files/206/Summary-of-FIRRMA.pdfhttps://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10177https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/international/the-committee-on-foreign-investment-in-the-united-states-cfius/cfius-overviewhttps://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/RHG_TWS_2022_US-Outbound-Investment.pdf#page=8https://www.akerman.com/a/web/93pZea8UZzh4V6HMJ6XYP5/7H1vd7/worldecr-article.pdf#page=3https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/2021-06-07_R46814_4ada880cd0a8b2b2822d942b4114828c13908820.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/644187/EPRS_BRI(2019)644187_EN.pdf https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/about-bis/newsroom/press-releases/3158-2022-10-07-bis-press-release-advanced-computing-and-semiconductor-manufacturing-controls-final/file https://thediplomat.com/2022/12/why-europe-struggles-with-us-export-controls-on-china/", "matched_news_url": "https://thediplomat.com/2022/12/why-europe-struggles-with-us-export-controls-on-china/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Diplomat"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/64ef2042-9ece-4b0c-ad02-184c3454f43b", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/64ef2042-9ece-4b0c-ad02-184c3454f43b", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "approach to outbound investment screening    On 9 August 2023, US President Joe Biden issued an executive order to regulate certain types of US outboundinvestment in semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies and artificialintelligence sectors in countries of concern, where this investment may be a threat to US national security.Investment in these technologies or subsets of them will be subject to notification rules, or prohibited.

For economic growth to match population growth, Sub-Saharan Africa would have to create 18 million jobs per year (IMF, 2015). The most obvious risks of not succeeding in this relate to water and food supply crises, and the long term impact on human development and thus on building resilience: malnutrition in early childhood can impairs physical and cognitive development. The risk then emerges of a major pandemic, which could spread through the region and indeed globally. These risks are even more pressing in \u201cfragile states.\u201d These tend to have the highest levels of fertility, and governance seems unable to address the huge challenges they face. Fragile states are also the most affected by climate change and extreme weather events, particularly drought, and by instability related to terrorism. In areas where economic growth is insufficient to support the population, increased migration outflows are to be expected (NIC, 2017). Migration to the advanced economies represents a minority of these flows. However, this is growing faster than that within the region, and 90 % is economically driven (IMF, 2017). Inside the region, migration is likely to speed up the current trend of rapid urbanisation. While this can have positive effects on fertility, the emergence of a younger, more urban and more networked population may strengthen the existing trends of tensions based on religious affiliations and of protests fuelled by corruption, rising inflation, high unemployment and poor economic performance. The rage of the young may increase ethnic tension and religious extremism, particularly of radical Islam and of fundamentalist Christian groups (NIC, 2017). The African Institute for Security Studies lists widespread youth unemployment and a median age of less than 25 as key drivers in creating the conditions for armed conflict (ISS, 2013). The difference in fertility rates between communities might add to these tensions. The rest of the world would be economically affected. The Atlantic Council notes that \u201ca poorly educated African workforce has negative implications for long-term global growth potential\u201d, also for global security (Atlantic Council p. 17).

During a plenary debate to prepare the June European Council, where many MEPs criticised the lack of decision by the Council on this issue, the European Parliament's President, Antonio Tajani, stressed that Parliament had agreed its position on the matter in November 2017, and that its text would be an ideal basis for a compromise. On 14-15 December 2017, Heads of State or Government held an informal discussion on migration without any written conclusions, in the Leaders\u2019 meetings format, which set the aim of deciding on the CEAS at the June 2018 meeting. President Tusk underlined that he still aimed to find a decision by consensus, but that reaching a compromise on the relocation mechanism might be hard to achieve and that the use of QMV would be an alternative if no compromise could be found. According to the new working methods under the Leaders\u2019 Agenda, the result of the discussions at the informal leaders\u2019 meetings should lead to an agreement at the following formal meeting dedicated to the matter \u2013 in this case the June European Council.

Testing is considered an essential aspect of the response to the pandemic. There are different types of coronavirus tests, each having its own merits and limitations. The timing of tests is also critical. Among the tests that detect current infection, (rapid) antigen tests have recently come to the fore. In view of a resurgence of coronavirus cases, the European Commission adopted on 28 October 2020 a recommendation for a common EU testing approach for Covid-19. It addresses key points linked to testing capacities and resources, as well as rapid antigen tests. This was followed on 18 November by a recommendation on the use of rapid antigen tests for the diagnosis of Covid-19, which provides guidance on how to select rapid antigen tests, when they are appropriate and who should perform them.

This can be done by focussing either on the virus's specific genetic material, using a technique known as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), or on specific molecules (antigens) present on the viral surface. These two test types are referred to, respectively, as RT-PCR-based tests (PCR tests in short) and antigen tests. PCR tests \u2013 the earliest available since the start of the pandemic \u2013 are considered the most reliable method for detecting Covid-19. 2 However, they require trained personnel, specific substances and expensive machines that take hours to provide results. This has led to capacity bottlenecks and long testing turnaround times. Antigen tests (often called rapid antigen tests) offer the possibility of faster, simpler and more inexpensive detection using rapid immunoassays on swab samples. Newgeneration tests return results within 15 to 30 minutes. At present, antigen tests are performed by trained personnel, but they may soon be simple enough to be used at home (see 'Outlook'). On the downside, they are generally regarded as having a lower diagnostic accuracy 3 than PCR tests, 4 and their appropriate use appears to depend on timing (see Figure 1) and settings (more under 'EU and international public health bodies' recommendations'). 5 Saliva tests \u2013 also based on viral genetic detection \u2013 are emerging as another fast and convenient testing option, but the jury is still out on their real role. Some studies show that saliva is less sensitive than nasopharyngeal swabs, with the number of false negatives too high to make them really useful, while others suggest that saliva is better. Saliva sampling may likely be of value for identifying asymptomatic people with a medium to high viral load in the context of screening campaigns. https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/nasopharyngealhttps://www.nature.com/scitable/content/reverse-transcription-converts-mrna-into-cdna-6697865/https://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/polymerase-chain-reaction-pcr-110/https://www.britannica.com/science/antigenhttps://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Turnaround+Timeshttps://e-santewallonie.be/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Se%CC%81rologie-SARS-CoV2-JCV.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3735771/ https://time.com/5891887/covid-19-saliva-spit-test/ https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2016359 https://www.famhp.be/en/news/coronavirus_evaluation_of_the_use_of_saliva_samples_as_an_alternative_to_sampling_via_a_deep https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/viral+load", "matched_news_url": "https://time.com/5891887/covid-19-saliva-spit-test/", "matched_news_outlet": "Time Magazine"}, {"reference_string": "Coronavirus testing will continue to play an important role, from diagnosing infections, to enabling enhanced understanding of disease spread, to helping contain disease transmission, to providing insights into immunity and aiding the development of therapeutics and vaccines.

Unlike similar EU measures, most of its climate support is done via tax subsidies. Although hailed in the EU for heralding a new era in US climate policy, the IRA is being criticised for its outright 'Buy American' provisions. Amongst others, it is feared that EU exports to the US will be hampered, and that EU firms might be enticed to relocate to the US. So far, the EU has reacted by adapting its State aid rules and the legislative proposals of the Green Deal Industrial Plan, but it also relies upon the Recovery and Resilience Facility's dedicated climate subsidies to offset the IRA's effects on the EU economy. Further possible EU responses are currently discussed.", "published_on": "2023-06-02", "added_on": "2023-06-08", "document_url": "https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/IPOL_IDA(2023)740087", "pdf_url": "https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2023/740087/IPOL_IDA(2023)740087_EN.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/euparl_library/c70f504d48f493da1a1826e9661e6d95.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/euparl_library/c70f504d48f493da1a1826e9661e6d95.png", "topics": ["Renewable energy", "Efficient energy use", "Subsidy", "European Union", "Sustainable energy", "European Green Deal", "Next Generation EU", "Tax", "Energy development", "Carbon neutrality", "Climate change mitigation", "Electric vehicle", "European single market", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "The European Semester", "Zero-emissions vehicle", "World Trade Organization", "Plug-in hybrid", "Infrastructure", "Economy", "Individual retirement account", "Inflation", "Competition (economics)", "Inflation Reduction Act of 2022", "Biodiesel", "Most favoured nation", "Council of the European Union", "Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union", "Green vehicle", "Low-carbon economy", "Transport", "Policy", "Tax credit", "Energy conservation", "United States", "Hybrid electric vehicle", "Car", "Trade agreement", "Joe Biden", "Debt", "Trade and Technology Council", "Export", "European Union competition law", "Government budget balance", "Politics"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economy", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>energy and resource", "politics>government", "politics", "science and technology"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": [], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1080/00396338.2023.2193101", "title": "The Energy Transition, Protectionism and Transatlantic Relations", "journal": "Survival", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.2861/0467", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2861/285489", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2761/591643", "title": null, "publisher": null}], "policy": [{"overton_id": "euparl_library-80182532e65be85def92b01a1f460571", "title": "EU-US climate and energy relations in light of the Inflation Reduction Act", "policy_source_id": "euparl_library"}, {"overton_id": "bruegel-8cbfa883a65ffa19396814315a604c46", "title": "How Europe should answer the US Inflation Reduction Act", "policy_source_id": "bruegel"}, {"overton_id": "bruegel-77f0d9d5e670439ad1365891de063a3f", "title": "A European climate fund or a green golden rule: not as different as they seem", "policy_source_id": "bruegel"}, {"overton_id": "europa-833cbdac7a5eabb3526ea097b8dbf78c", "title": "EU budget policy brief : the EU as an issuer : the NextGenerationEU transformation. #3, July 2022.", "policy_source_id": "europa"}, {"overton_id": "pacificresearchinstitute-ca7dfd3349c7b2813f1317610fb4ec62", "title": "Inflation Reduction Act Nightmare Targets Life-Savings Meds - Pacific Research Institute", "policy_source_id": "pacificresearchinstitute"}, {"overton_id": "imf-615ff1b9d2a59cc1b83caeb01f789a6c", "title": "\"Low for Long\" and Risk-Taking", "policy_source_id": "imf"}], "news": [{"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65649229", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65649229", "matched_news_outlet": "BBC News"}], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "national security, and invest in research and development, science and technology, and theworkforce of the future to keep the United States the leader in the industries of tomorrow, includingnanotechnology, clean energy, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence.

This amount will almost entirely cover the total cost of the plan, estimated at \u20ac4 708.3 million. So far, the Netherlands has not requested any loans.

China is reportedly providing US$97 billion in national and regional funds for the 2014-2024 period, and South Korea has introduced 6-10 % breaks and other measures, in efforts to attract another US$225 billion and US$450 billion in Chinese and Korean investments over a 10-year period.

Preliminary talks with German officials have taken place following the intention expressed by TSMC and Taiwan's foreign minister to establish a foundry there and engage in semiconductor cooperation in Europe.

Its 'super-aged' society is the oldest in the world: 28.7 % of the population are 65 or older, with women forming the majority. The country is also home to a record 80 000 centenarians. By 2036, people aged 65 and over will represent a third of the population. Since 2011, the Japanese population has also been shrinking: it is a rare case of large country whose overall population is becoming smaller in prosperous and peaceful times. Japan's population is expected to drop from 127 million in 2015 to 88 million by 2065. Japan's demographic crisis is the consequence of the combination of two elements: a high life expectancy and a low fertility rate. In 2018, Japan had the second highest life expectancy in the world.

That paper took stock of a dramatic shift under way in the global economy, with Asia accounting for an ever-greater share of world economic activity, trade and consumption, and offering opportunities for Australian exporters that could be maximised by deepening the country's business and cultural ties with its northern neighbours. Australia was then negotiating a free trade agreement with China, which in 2009 had become Australia's most important export destination, and in 2010 had overtaken Japan to become the world's second largest economy. The China\u2013Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) was concluded in 2014, coinciding with a speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Australia's parliament, and the announcement of a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' between the two countries. The 2012 white paper presented the Indo-Pacific as an economically dynamic region with China at its heart, offering opportunities to be seized through diplomatic and strategic engagement backed up by domestic educational and economic reforms. https://thediplomat.com/2012/12/a-term-whose-time-has-come-the-indo-pacific/ https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22media/pressrel/2010380%22 https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/chafta/Pages/australia-china-fta https://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-17/xi-peace/5897680 https://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/china/china-country-brief https://www.politico.eu/article/how-china-xi-jinping-lost-australia-trade-diplomacy/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/app5.129", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/how-china-xi-jinping-lost-australia-trade-diplomacy/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://thediplomat.com/2018/03/what-does-a-free-and-open-indo-pacific-actually-mean/", "matched_news_url": "https://thediplomat.com/2018/03/what-does-a-free-and-open-indo-pacific-actually-mean/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Diplomat"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://thediplomat.com/2021/09/what-does-free-and-open-really-mean-for-the-indo-pacific/", "matched_news_url": "https://thediplomat.com/2021/09/what-does-free-and-open-really-mean-for-the-indo-pacific/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Diplomat"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-australia-renew-defence-pact-sign-security-agreements-2021-09-09/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-australia-renew-defence-pact-sign-security-agreements-2021-09-09/", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://thediplomat.com/2021/09/australia-indonesia-agree-to-ramp-up-defense-relationship/", "matched_news_url": "https://thediplomat.com/2021/09/australia-indonesia-agree-to-ramp-up-defense-relationship/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Diplomat"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/23/former-pms-apologise-to-pacific-leaders-for-australias-apathy-on-climate-crisis", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/23/former-pms-apologise-to-pacific-leaders-for-australias-apathy-on-climate-crisis", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://thediplomat.com/2021/09/how-konfrontasi-reshaped-southeast-asian-regional-politics/", "matched_news_url": "https://thediplomat.com/2021/09/how-konfrontasi-reshaped-southeast-asian-regional-politics/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Diplomat"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://thediplomat.com/2021/03/the-quad-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not/", "matched_news_url": "https://thediplomat.com/2021/03/the-quad-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Diplomat"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/aukus-alliance-pm-has-shown-true-leadership-at-a-crucial-time/news-story/87804ed7706af966d228417746aa3366", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/aukus-alliance-pm-has-shown-true-leadership-at-a-crucial-time/news-story/87804ed7706af966d228417746aa3366", "matched_news_outlet": "The Australian"}, {"reference_string": "7 On 6 October 2021, the Australian government announced that it was ending an agreement with Papua New Guinea to detain asylum seekers who have attempted to enter Australia illegally for processing.

Since 2015, the EU has been making efforts to narrow this investment gap and support global connectivity, not least to counter the influence of China's Belt and Road Initiative.

The Atlantic Council sheds some light on the scale of the shortages: 'nearly eight hundred million people in the world do not have access to electricity and basic drinking water services. The vast majority of these people reside in low-income economies, including Sub-Saharan African and many South Asian regions. Moreover [...] around 3.2 billion people around the world do not use the internet and only sixteen out of one hundred people have broadband subscriptions.' The World Bank reckons that '2.4 billion lack improved sanitation facilities, 1 billion live more than 2 kilometres from an all-season road, and uncounted numbers are unable to access work and educational opportunities due to the absence or high cost of transport services.' This is perhaps unsurprising given the enormous investment gap between high-income and middle- and low-income economies (see Figure 2). Notably, as much as 80 % of private investment in infrastructure projects between 2012 and 2021 occurred in high-income countries and only 20 % in middle- and low-income countries. 2 https://devpolicy.org/the-polycrisis-and-global-development-finance-options-and-dilemmas-20221114/ https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/the-global-infrastructure-financing-gap-where-sovereign-wealth-funds-swfs-and-pension-funds-can-come-in/ https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/31291/211363ov.pdf?sequence=19", "matched_news_outlet": "The Atlantic"}], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "human-centric digital transformation covering fields such as data    8                                        The Global Gateway    protection, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and digital skills.

It is structured around four pillars: connecting the region; protecting the environment; building prosperity; and strengthening the region. Similar to the other macro-regional strategies, the EUSDR does not have its own budget. Its implementation depends on the mobilisation of funds from other relevant sources (EU, national, regional, private) and on well-coordinated use of available funding instruments at different levels. The principle of embedding the MRS priorities within the 2021-2027 national/regional EU funding programmes, in particular the European structural and investment funds (ESI), is gaining prominence.

To this scope, DSAs cover an increasing number of indicators; systematically include both\nimplicit and contingent liabilities, and use statistical methods to quantify highly risky \u201ctail events\u201d.\nFurthermore, DSAs more and more often set \u201cdebt limits\u201d, by adopting thresholds for debt and payment\nflows, which are used to single out enhanced vulnerability.\nWhile these developments mark true progress, this paper notes that some issues should be incorporated to\nimprove the predictive capacity of DSA, focusing mainly on liquidity (versus solvency) risks and contagion\nrisks. The identification of fixed \u201cdebt thresholds\u201d is another critical area, limiting DSA effectiveness: the\nauthor argues that such limits should not be fix, neither across countries nor over time.\nIn his paper Prof Corsetti, explains why DSA should embed potentially available official support: according\nto this approach, therefore, an incomplete lending architecture as currently in the EMU constitutes a hurdle\nfor an effective DSA. The author also shows that different risks require different financial assistance tools, and\nthat the (negative) role of self-fulfilling expectations can be prevented by designing appropriate instruments,\nwhile taking into account moral hazard aspects.\nThe paper concludes with a comparative assessment of current standard DSAs models and applications,\nsuggests directions for further improvement, and discusses the correct use of DSAs in light of the strengths\nand weaknesses inherent the underlying methodologies."}]}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "digitalisation and artificial intelligence on labour marketsaddressed a number of measures that could lead to efficiency gainsin the Euro Area.

recovery so far is underpinned by an imbalanced growth pattern. Given that exports from most economies have plummeted, as they are still deeply mired in the pandemic, China has bridged disrupted export capacities. However, China's economic recovery will need to be driven more by domestic demand, consumer spending and public spending. Consumer spending is traditionally weak in China and has remained modest during the pandemic, only gradually catching up. This slow recovery has been led mainly by the more affluent Chinese income brackets and differs widely across regions. A broad-based domestic consumption pattern has not (yet) emerged, since the pandemic has hit low-income brackets in China disproportionately harder, notably rural migrant workers unable to find new jobs in cities, with 63.35 % of migrant workers surveyed in 2020 stating that they had no job prospects if they returned to their rural home towns, against 35.3 % during the 2008 financial crisis. With household expenditure, on services in particular, still in decline in September 2020, the government's focus was on public spending. https://www.ft.com/content/e0e2940a-17cb-40ed-8d27-3722c9349a5d https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-020-00608-w", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e0e2940a-17cb-40ed-8d27-3722c9349a5d", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/e842dceb-d97c-42f7-bc3a-347c864d6e46", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e842dceb-d97c-42f7-bc3a-347c864d6e46", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/157310ef-d404-479e-9566-3503b77d49e9", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/157310ef-d404-479e-9566-3503b77d49e9", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/843b3f60-292b-431f-a94c-93c78bc72bae", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/843b3f60-292b-431f-a94c-93c78bc72bae", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/ae57ef0b-e77d-4724-b26b-78f13a0665ac", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ae57ef0b-e77d-4724-b26b-78f13a0665ac", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/c30eb13a-f49e-4d42-b2a8-1c6f70bb4d55", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c30eb13a-f49e-4d42-b2a8-1c6f70bb4d55", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://thediplomat.com/2020/04/china-and-the-budapest-belgrade-railway-saga/", "matched_news_url": "https://thediplomat.com/2020/04/china-and-the-budapest-belgrade-railway-saga/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Diplomat"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://thediplomat.com/2020/11/chinas-bri-and-its-high-speed-railways-to-nowhere/", "matched_news_url": "https://thediplomat.com/2020/11/chinas-bri-and-its-high-speed-railways-to-nowhere/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Diplomat"}, {"reference_string": "1 China's Covid-19 figures do not take into account asymptomatic infections.

Resilience is likely to improve through diversification and the accelerated uptake of digital technologies such as AI, robotics, blockchain, the Internet of Things and 3D printing, which reduce the need for labour and facilitate trade. A full decoupling from China seems unfeasible in most cases, but diversification through the increasingly debated 'China Plus One' strategy, in which a company supplements a Chinese supplier with another one from south-east Asia, may be a more likely scenario. https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/35890/Natural-Disasters-and-the-Reshaping-of-Global-Value-Chains.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=yhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/662903/IPOL_STU(2021)662903_EN.pdfhttps://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/covid-scenario-planning-winning-the-future-serieshttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/662903/IPOL_STU(2021)662903_EN.pdf#page=67https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/600223300a3685fe68016a484ee867fb-0350012021/related/Global-Economic-Prospects-June-2021-Topical-Issue-1.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/641544/EPRS_STU(2020)641544_EN.pdf https://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/reshoring-and-new-globalization-the-future-of-supply-chains/ https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/ersd202103_e.pdf#page=14 https://thediplomat.com/2020/09/south-koreas-struggle-to-bring-manufacturing-home/ https://www.iiss.org/blogs/research-paper/2020/08/covid-19-trade-and-supply-chains", "matched_news_url": "https://thediplomat.com/2020/09/south-koreas-struggle-to-bring-manufacturing-home/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Diplomat"}, {"reference_string": "2 Before the pandemic, about 55 % of air cargo was carried on passenger aeroplanes. https://www.ft.com/content/c84351be-bf98-4831-9e7f-428f9c01f06b", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c84351be-bf98-4831-9e7f-428f9c01f06b", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/8fd09156-434c-45c6-8d26-3765b98f1980", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8fd09156-434c-45c6-8d26-3765b98f1980", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "emerging economies create more domestic and regional supply chains and alsoproduce more for their domestic markets. 1 Rising wages in developing countries, the increased roleof services and the impact of technologies such as automation and artificial intelligence AI make itincreasingly economical and greener to bring manufacturing closer to customers.

Another example is the relationship with Norway, which has been proactive in expressing its willingness to take part in EU initiatives, demonstrated by its participation in the military mobility project in PESCO. The transatlantic relationship, Europe's longest partnership, is high on the agenda. Following the election of President Joe Biden, the renewed impetus to increase cooperation and identify transatlantic solutions to global problems was confirmed by the statement following a bilateral EU-US Summit in June 2021, which included a commitment to launch a security and defence dialogue. At the same time, the rapid US withdrawal from Afghanistan has prompted debates across the political spectrum about America's future role in the world and about its consequences for Europe, notably for its identity as a security and defence actor. https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/696176/EPRS_BRI(2021)696176_EN.pdfhttps://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/104404/informal-eu-foreign-ministers-meeting-remarks-high-representative-josep-borrell-press_enhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/15/remarks-by-president-biden-prime-minister-morrison-of-australia-and-prime-minister-johnson-of-the-united-kingdom-announcing-the-creation-of-aukus/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/05/06/pesco-canada-norway-and-the-united-states-will-be-invited-to-participate-in-the-project-military-mobility/https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2021/690660/EPRS_IDA(2021)690660_EN.pdf https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/06/15/eu-us-summit-statement-towards-a-renewed-transatlantic-partnership/ https://ecfr.eu/publication/the-fall-of-the-afghan-government-and-what-it-means-for-europe/ https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2021-09-02/american-credibility-after-afghanistan https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/09/afghanistan-taliban-europe-britain/619985/ https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/breton/blog/afghanistan-common-european-defence-no-longer-option_en", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/09/afghanistan-taliban-europe-britain/619985/", "matched_news_outlet": "The Atlantic"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/17/france-invokes-eu-article-427-what-does-it-mean", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/17/france-invokes-eu-article-427-what-does-it-mean", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-14/eu-to-focus-on-diversifying-crucial-supply-chains-says-borrell", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-14/eu-to-focus-on-diversifying-crucial-supply-chains-says-borrell", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "competitive edge andpromote technological sovereignty.

Despite the fact that there are substantial implications for the EU budget, the European Parliament is largely excluded from decisions on the mobilisation, implementation and scrutiny of budgetary resources using this legal basis. Furthermore, there is also an increased risk of fraud and corruption affecting EU funds when substantial amounts of money are made available under lighter conditions due to the need for fast emergency spending under the crisis. This has raised concerns in the international community. The European Chief Prosecutor, head of the new European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, has warned of coronavirus-related fraud and corruption such as 'awarding of procurement contracts without open bids, or the use of fake documents to buy medical equipment or drugs at artificially inflated prices'. The package of measures adopted by the EU institutions involves a considerable degree of flexibility, such as the Regulation on specific measures to provide exceptional flexibility for the use of the European structural and investment funds in response to the coronavirus outbreak. This legal act provides for exceptional measures for the use of ESI funds in response to the outbreak, derogating from existing legislation to allow for, among other things, a co-financing rate of 100 %, transfers between categories of regions in response to the outbreak, elimination of the requirements on thematic concentration, and exemption of the need for review or update of ex ante assessments. https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/support_to_mitigate_unemployment_risks_in_an_emergency_sure_0.pdfhttp://www.oecd.org/corruption/the-global-response-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic-must-not-be-undermined-by-bribery.htm https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-corruption-inte/virus-response-opens-way-for-corruption-eu-chief-prosecutor-idUSKBN22O1SG https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ%3AL%3A2020%3A130%3ATOC&uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2020.130.01.0001.01.ENG", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-corruption-inte/virus-response-opens-way-for-corruption-eu-chief-prosecutor-idUSKBN22O1SG", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "As democracy appears to be in decline across the world, the unfolding coronavirus pandemic has further accelerated pre-existing systemic tensions and competition between liberal democracies and different variants of authoritarian regime. The outbreak has exposed the weaknesses of centralised, top-down systems, prompting authoritarian leaders to further stifle criticism, increase efforts to control the narrative and exploit divisions between democratic states \u2013 including transatlantic ties \u2013 to expand their strategic influence. Use of these tools poses broad and severe challenges to the liberal world order. As 'Trumpism' has jeopardised the leadership of the United States, the European Union has found itself with fewer allies. Moreover, the Union is challenged from within through democratic backsliding in some of its own Member States.

Ten years after the Global Financial Crisis, GDP remains below its pre-crisis trend in many economies and interest rates continue to be very low worldwide. This raises the question of whether low GDP growth and low interest rates are a temporary phenomenon or are due to a decline in long-run growth prospects (potential output growth) and equilibrium real interest rates (natural interest rate).

As a showcase, the article published in May 2022 by Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Centre until early 2022, and now member of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC): 'How Russia must reinvent itself to defeat the West 'hybrid war': Russia's very existence is under threat.' https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/09/russia-brutal-arrests-and-torture-ill-treatment-anti-war-protesters https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2022)729297 https://www.levada.ru/en/2022/11/01/conflict-with-ukraine-october-2022/ https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/where-have-russians-been-fleeing-since-mobilisation-began-2022-10-06/ https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/06/06/why-russian-intellectuals-are-hardening-support-for-war-in-ukraine/ https://carnegiemoscow.org/commentary/86304 https://eng.globalaffairs.ru/articles/russia-must-reinvent-itself/ https://russiancouncil.ru/en/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/where-have-russians-been-fleeing-since-mobilisation-began-2022-10-06/", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "estimated 100 000 casualties, depriving itself of its best units and revealing its extraordinary weaknesses, and consumed a large arsenal of costly weaponry, difficult to replenish under the sanctions regime. Geopolitically, Russia has achieved the opposite of the declared objectives: NATO will become larger and closer to Russian borders with the incorporation of Sweden and Finland, Ukraine's national identity has been reinforced and its European aspirations, alongside Moldova's and Georgia's, have been firmly consolidated. Meanwhile, Russia is rapidly losing space in what it considered a safe sphere of influence in the Southern Caucasus and Central Asia. Internationally, Russia finds itself increasingly cornered with the status of a pariah state: self-excluded from the Council of Europe, banned from cultural and sports events, condemned and held accountable by the UN General Assembly, designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the European Parliament, following similar resolutions by several EU national parliaments. The G20 meeting in Indonesia was a resounding diplomatic blow for Russia, which will find itself increasingly dwarfed by its alleged regional partner, China. The challenges ahead for the Kremlin are multiple, mounting and feeding each other. The immobility until 2036, which Putin assured for himself with the 2020 constitutional amendments, is less sure than before, and speculation on possible scenarios multiply.

Unlike traditional services, Mode 5 services are not subject to the existing international trade regime under the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).

Ten years later, the European Council is seen by many as representing the centre of gravity of the EU's institutional framework. However, was this development purely the result of the changes to the Treaties made with Lisbon or did it happen naturally over time? This study analyses both the formal changes brought about by the Lisbon Treaty and the incremental evolution resulting from the institution's day-to-day practice, including the European Council's behaviour during the various crises of the last decade. It outlines the responsibilities envisaged for the European Council in the Treaty and the informal roles it has taken on over time. It explores the extent to which the Lisbon Treaty changed the functioning of the European Council, and how EU leaders themselves tried to optimise the working methods of their institution.

This technology could deliver savings of 0.7 % in fuel consumption and emissions and could be available on new aircraft types from around 2035. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44383220", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44383220", "matched_news_outlet": "BBC News"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-15/why-carbon-offsets-don-t-do-all-that-they-promise-quicktake", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-15/why-carbon-offsets-don-t-do-all-that-they-promise-quicktake", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "automated ATM;2.

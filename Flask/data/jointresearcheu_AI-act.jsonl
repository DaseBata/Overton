The report presents the results of the mapping of the use of AI in public services. The findings are based on three pillars: (i) an analysis of national strategies by European Member States on AI that focuses on how these strategies describe policy actions to address AI development in the public sector, (ii) an inventory of AI use cases in the public sector to provide an overview of the status of AI implementation in Europe, and (iii) in-depth case studies which describe in detail the factors and consequences crucial for the responsible development and adoption of AI. The findings highlight that the use of AI by public administrations is growing. AI technologies could significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public administrations.

Although the geographical focus is on the EU27, when possible we provide a comparison with major worldwide AI powerhouses, i.e., the US and China, among others. Also, when available, an indicator is provided for the 27 EU Member States. The analysis is structured in five dimensions: (i) global view on the AI landscape, (ii) industry, (iii) research and development (R&D), (iv) technology, and (v) societal aspects. The results show, as expected, that AI is in a phase of technological evolution and improvement. The US is in a leading position in the worldwide landscape in economic terms.

In addition, we took into consideration the results of two workshops with young people and three workshops with experts and policymakers that contributed to the formulation of a set of requirements, methods and knowledge gaps as an integrated agenda for research and policy on AI and the rights of the child.", "published_on": "2022-06-06", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC127564", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC127564/JRC127564_01.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/b8badac1083f3e040c1c9b66e5b11836.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/b8badac1083f3e040c1c9b66e5b11836.png", "topics": ["Artificial intelligence", "Privacy", "Education", "General Data Protection Regulation", "Embodied cognition", "European Union", "Research", "Recommender system", "Explainable artificial intelligence", "Risk", "Children's rights", "Child", "Technology", "Robot", "Robotics", "System", "Governance", "Evaluation", "Cognitive science", "Branches of science", "Cognition", "Policy", "Multistakeholder governance", "Learning", "Social media", "Sustainability", "Social robot", "Evidence-based medicine", "Adolescence", "Convention on the Rights of the Child", "Information privacy", "Personal data", "Autonomy", "Computing", "Information", "Algorithmic bias", "Empowerment", "Issues in ethics", "Bias", "Cloud computing", "Sustainable Development Goals", "Literacy", "Concepts in metaphysics", "Intelligence", "Science", "YouTube", "Media literacy"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "lifestyle and leisure", "lifestyle and leisure>leisure", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology>software", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>media", "society", "lifestyle and leisure>leisure>game"], "source_tags": ["Information society", "Innovation and growth"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/012329", "9789276518372", "JRC127564", "EUR 31048 EN", "OP KJ-NA-31048-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.48550/arxiv.1906.02243", "title": "Energy and Policy Considerations for Deep Learning in NLP", "publisher": "arXiv"}, {"doi": "10.48550/arxiv.1912.11564", "title": "Online Music Listening Culture of Kids and Adolescents: Listening Analysis and Music Recommendation Tailored to the Young", "publisher": "arXiv"}, {"doi": "10.1109/ieeestd.2020.9084219\u00b3\u2074", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.24908/ss.v12i2.4776", "title": "Datafication, dataism and dataveillance: Big Data between scientific paradigm and ideology", "journal": "Surveillance & Society", "publisher": "Queen's University Library"}, {"doi": "10.1080/17482798.2018.1521677", "title": "Researching datafied children as data citizens", "journal": "Journal of Children and Media", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1038/s41467-019-14108-y", "title": "The role of artificial intelligence in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals", "journal": "Nature Communications", "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC"}, {"doi": "10.1145/3109859.3109956", "title": "KidRec: Children &amp;

The implementation and relevance of the assessment list established by the independent High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG) as a tool to translate the seven requirements that AI systems should meet in order to be trustworthy, defined in the Ethics Guidelines, are discussed in detail and contextualized for the field of AVs. The general behaviour of an AV depends on a set of multiple, complex, interrelated Artificial Intelligence (AI) based systems, each dealing with problems of different nature. The application context of AVs can intuitively be considered high-risk, and their adoption involves addressing significant technical, political and societal challenges. However, AVs could bring substantial benefits, improving safety, mobility, and the environment.

This information can be used to detect th e types of organic materials present on the surface. 4.3.2.2. Raman spectroscopy (RS) [7, 8] It is used to examine the energy levels of molecules that cannot be well character-ized via infrared spectroscopy. Th e two techniques, however, are complimentary. In the RS, a sample is irradiated with a strong monochromatic light source (usu-ally a laser). Most of the radiation will scatter or \"reflect off' the sample at the same energy as the incoming laser radiation. However, a small amount will scat-ter from the sample at a wavelength slightly shifted from the original wavelength. It is possible to study the molecular structure or determine the chemical identity of the sample. It is quite straightforward to identify compounds by spectral library search. Due to extensive library spectral information, the unique spectral finger-print of every compound, and the ease with which such analyses can be per-formed, the RS is a very useful technique for various applications. An important application of the RS is the rapid, nondestructive characterization of diamond, diamond-like, and amorphous-carbon films. 4.3.2.3. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) / energy dispersive X-ra y analysis (EDX) [7, 8] The SEM produce s detailed photographs that provide important information about the surface structure and morphology of almost any kind of sample. Image analy-sis is often the first and most important step in problem solving and failure analy-sis. With SEM, a focused beam of high-energy electrons is scanned over the sur-face of a material, causing a variety of signals, secondary electrons, X-rays, photons, etc. - each of which may be used to characterize the material with re-spect to specific properties . The signals are used to modulate the brightness on a CRT display, thereb y providing a high-resolution map of the selected material property. It is a surface imaging technique, but with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) it can identify elements in the near-surface region. This technique is most useful for imaging particles. 4.3.2.4. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) [7, 8] Incident X-rays are used to excite surface atoms. The atoms relax through the emission of an X-ray with energy characteristic of the parent atoms and the inten-sity proportional to the amount of the element present. It is a bulk or \"total mate-rials\" characterization technique for rapid, simultaneous, and nondestructive analysis of elements having an atomic number higher than that of boron. Tradi-tional bulk analysis applications include identifying metals and alloys, detecting trace elements in liquids, and identifying residues and deposits. 4.3.2.5. Total-reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) [7, 8] It is a special XRF technique that provides extremely sensitive measures of the elements present in a material's outer surface. Applications include searching for metal contamination in thin films on silicon wafers and detecting picogram-levels o f arsenic, lead, mercury and cadmium on hazardous, chemical fume hoods.",

These three elements are studied in three different contexts: regular work settings, Digital Labour Platforms and content sharing platforms. The implications of these new forms of work for work organisation and working conditions are also discussed. The findings show that a small but significant proportion of workers in the two countries analysed are subject to digital monitoring and algorithmic management systems at work to some degree.

A robust and performing technical infrastructure is essential but insufficient to ensure a sustainable thriving of digital environments. Both technical and legal stability are necessary to cherish for the mutual benefit of service providers, their users and society at large. This stability is crucial to ensure the robustness and competitiveness of digital value chains and the thriving of the European digital ecosystem.Against this backdrop, this report explores crucial organisational and legal aspects of managing and coordinating digital interactions through APIs. Specifically, the analysis describes API-related legal obligations and applicable law. The study also analyses the current practices of coordination and negotiation with their digital counterparts in eight different organisations. Finally, the work analyses the clauses and conditions encoded in 4K API's Term of...", "published_on": "2022-10-18", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC129940", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC129940/JRC129940_01.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/17c2a20a779459029835bd3f34fe0523.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/17c2a20a779459029835bd3f34fe0523.png", "topics": ["Information technology", "Computing", "Technology", "Law", "Intellectual property", "Governance", "Contract", "API", "Data.europa.eu", "Business", "General Data Protection Regulation", "Interoperability", "Electronic Commerce Directive 2000", "Digital Single Market", "Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology", "European Union", "Copyright", "Patent"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "crime, law and justice", "crime, law and justice>law", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology", "science and technology", "crime, law and justice>law>civil law>regulation", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology>software", "crime, law and justice>law>civil law"], "source_tags": ["Information society", "Innovation and growth", "Standards"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/511499", "9789276567950", "JRC129940", "EUR 31216 EN", "OP KJ-NA-31-216-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2760/151339", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2139/ssrn.3706099", "title": "Recommendations on the European Commission\u2019s WHITE PAPER on Artificial Intelligence -

New methods for handling analytics however allow to close this gap and to preserve both privacy and knowledge. Compared to other privacy-preservation techniques, synthetic data can have the best value/effort performance. Synthetic population models facilitate application of novel methods for data-driven policy formulation and evaluation, representing a unique opportunity. This report showcases several applications of structured population such as population activity-based modelling, knock-on effects of selective lock-downs during the COVID-19 pandemic, investigative analysis of existing policy instrument design in the energy transition domain, and applications for synthetic cancer patient records.The text carefully weighs pros and cons of synthetic data in these policy applications to provide actionable insights for decision makers on opp...", "published_on": "2022-06-13", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC128595", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC128595/JRC128595_01.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/461cb47452edd9568f37e68cf3bdc799.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/461cb47452edd9568f37e68cf3bdc799.png", "topics": ["Markov chain", "Machine learning", "Statistics", "Deep learning", "Privacy", "Artificial intelligence", "Synthetic data", "Consumption (economics)", "Governance", "Research", "Census", "Markov chain Monte Carlo", "Differential privacy", "Data", "Information", "Generative model", "Survey methodology", "Big data", "Data re-identification", "Hidden Markov model", "Technology", "Branches of science", "Policy", "Dependent and independent variables", "Correlation", "Risk", "Bayesian network", "Artificial neural network", "Analytics", "Mathematical optimization", "Time series", "Efficient energy use", "Generative adversarial network", "Simulation", "Gas", "Sampling (statistics)", "Data science", "Regression analysis", "European Union", "Applied mathematics", "Evaluation", "Monte Carlo method", "Science", "Cluster analysis", "Poverty", "Estimator", "Learning", "General Data Protection Regulation", "Reproducibility", "Behavior", "Personal data", "Data anonymization"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology", "science and technology", "science and technology>mathematics", "health"], "source_tags": ["Agriculture and food security", "Economic and monetary Union", "Energy and transport", "Health and consumer protection", "Information society", "Innovation and growth", "Safety and security"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/50072", "9789276534785", "JRC128595", "EUR 31116 EN", "OP KJ-NA-31116-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1109/isit45174.2021.9518220", "title": "$\\alpha$-Information-theoretic Privacy Watchdog and Optimal Privatization Scheme", "publisher": "IEEE"}, {"doi": "10.14778/3055540.3055542", "title": "Plausible deniability for privacy-preserving data synthesis", "journal": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "publisher": "VLDB Endowment"}, {"doi": "10.18564/jasss.2319", "title": "Generating a Synthetic Population of Individuals in Households: Sample-Free Vs Sample-Based Methods", "journal": "Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation", "publisher": "Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation"}, {"doi": "10.1038/s41467-019-10933-3", "title": "Estimating the success of re-identifications in incomplete datasets using generative models", "journal": "Nature Communications", "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC"}, {"doi": "10.2105/ajph.93.7.1149", "title": "Heat or Eat?

In order to manage this revolution before it erupts, scientists need\nto provide evidence that democratises decision-making. Should scientists not just\nprovide facts and evidence but also become involved in the political agendas? How\ndo scientists become the \u201chonest brokers\u201d, as postulated by keynote speaker Prof\nRoger Pielke and how can the JRC best play this role as the science service at the\nheart of the Commission? What can be achieved with science diplomacy? There\nwas consensus that science \u2013 and each scientist individually \u2013 have a responsibility\nto stand up for facts and evidence and make policymakers, politicians and\nthe public aware of them. As Prof Elena Cattaneo rightly pointed out, there are\nample opportunities to do this in our professional as well as daily lives. There was\nclear acknowledgement from MEP Christian Ehler as well as other participating\npolicy makers that the JRC is a trusted partner within the Commission to provide\nwell researched and top quality information. Ehler stressed that trust in science\nrequires scientific independence and argued for a stronger mandate of the JRC in\nthe Commission. The role of the JRC in the emerging field of science diplomacy\nwas also explored in dedicated sessions.\nNeed for trustworthy science: Linked to this second point, another important\ntopic was addressed in different sessions: Within a world where fact checking of\ninformation has become essential before we can trust what we hear, read and\nsee, it is essential that science remains a reliable, robust and trustworthy source\nof information for experts, decision makers and the public. Science builds on science,\nand therefore anything that is published and reported must be described\naccurately, reproducible and without bias. Elisabeth Harper-Bik gave compelling\nevidence that this is not always the case and that a surprisingly large number of\nscientific works actually include wrong images, manipulated data or are simply\nnot reproducible.

Drawing on academic research and grey literature, it focuses on a set of ongoing technical developments that could redefine education, and society at large, in fundamental ways. It provides insights into the affordances of those technologies and important societal implications, discussing how they may reconfigure education against the background of learning theory. It also takes into account the socio-material basis of digital technologies, as well as key factors \u2014such as climate change, demographic transitions, environmental concerns and the growth of mental health problems among the young\u2014 that are shaping the emerging educational landscape. The report aims to go beyond the state-of-the-art and facilitate richer discussions on the potential impact of emerging technologies in education in order to support long-term strategic thinking.

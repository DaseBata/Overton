It is intended to be accessible to scientific and lay readers, including those with no previous experience of ethical theory and analysis. The scope of the textbook is the ethics of scientific research involving human beings. It contains case studies relating to a variety of scientific disciplines, including biomedical and human life sciences, new technologies and the social sciences. These have been chosen to illustrate and facilitate discussion of key ethical issues, and to give a flavour of the range of research settings in which these issues occur.

Intensive farming systems are based on genetically uniform crops and livestock breeds, vulnerable to pests and diseases. High yields are obtained through dependency on external inputs (especially fossil energy, fertilizers and pesticides) which can cause decreased air, water, soil and food quality. Intensification and specialisation also bring about landscape changes, resulting in its homogenisation and destruction of traditional landscape elements and, consequently, loss of habitats.

The Water Directors set up an Expert Group on WFD & Agriculture, succeeding the former Strategic Steering Group on this issue. The continuation of the long-standing \u201cPRB-AGRI\u201d exercise was thus endorsed for continuation and the Pilot River Basins Network on agricultural issues was renamed as \"River Basins Network (RBN) on WFD and Agriculture\", PHASE IV (2010-2012).The objective of the RBN was to support the Expert Group in its work, by offering feed-back from the field and ensuring technical support. Moreover, Exercise outputs were to be disseminated to all other river basin managers, stakeholders and to the EG members, with the overall objective of the network is to provide practical examples/cases of good practice in RBMP\u2019s.This report presents the output of this 2010-2012 exercise, concretely cons...", "published_on": "2013-05-15", "added_on": "2022-12-19", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC81647", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC81647/lb-na-25978-en-n.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/cc77076d8d911f6cbecd6b869078a5fa.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/cc77076d8d911f6cbecd6b869078a5fa.png", "topics": ["Environmental science", "Hydrology", "Scottish Environment Protection Agency", "Water", "Wetland", "Aquifer", "Groundwater", "No-till farming", "Eutrophication", "Groundwater recharge", "Soil", "Fertilizer", "Agriculture", "Leaching (agriculture)", "Surface runoff", "Natural environment", "Natural resources", "Earth sciences", "Physical geography", "Environmental technology", "Environment", "Public participation", "Natural resource management", "Environmental engineering", "Biodiversity", "Environment Agency", "Human activities", "Manure", "Water pollution", "Nature", "Sustainable agriculture", "Landscape", "Buffer strip", "Carbon sequestration", "Buffer zone", "Water resources", "Riparian zone", "Sustainability", "Soil erosion", "Systems ecology"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "environment>natural resources", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>agriculture", "environment>natural resources>water", "environment", "environment>environmental pollution"], "source_tags": ["Agriculture and food security", "Environment and climate change"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2788/90550", "9789279299407", "JRC81647", "EUR 25978", "OP LB-NA-25978-EN-N"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1007/s11027-010-9212-7", "title": "Nitrogen fertilizer management for nitrous oxide (N2O) mitigation in intensive corn (Maize) production: an emissions reduction protocol for US Midwest agriculture", "journal": "Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change", "publisher": "Springer Nature"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.04.054", "title": "Transport and attenuation of dissolved glyphosate and AMPA in a stormwater wetland", "journal": "Chemosphere", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/s0065-2113(08)60915-3", "title": "The Effects of Cultivation on Soil Nitrogen Mineralization", "journal": "Advances in Agronomy", "publisher": "Elsevier"}, {"doi": "10.2134/jeq2006.0038", "title": "Emission of the Greenhouse Gases Nitrous Oxide and Methane from Constructed Wetlands in Europe", "journal": "Journal of Environment Quality", "publisher": "American Society of Agronomy"}, {"doi": "10.1079/sum2002103", "title": "Nitrate leaching from a shallow limestone soil growing a five course combinable crop rotation: the effects of crop husbandry and nitrogen fertilizer rate on losses from the second complete rotation", "journal": "Soil Use and Management", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.2134/jeq2004.0466", "title": "Can Constructed Wetlands Reduce the Diffuse Phosphorus Loads to Eutrophic Water in Cold Temperate Regions?", "journal": "Journal of Environment Quality", "publisher": "American Society of Agronomy"}, {"doi": "10.1081/ese-200055679", "title": "Function and Potential of Constructed Wetlands for the Control of N and P Transport from Agriculture and Peat Production in Boreal Climate", "journal": "Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part A", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1504/ijw.2007.015217", "title": "Integrated Constructed Wetlands: concept, design, site evaluation and performance", "journal": "International Journal of Water", "publisher": "Inderscience Publishers"}, {"doi": "10.2134/jeq2004.1124", "title": "Phosphorus Removal in a Wetland Constructed on Former Arable Land", "journal": "Journal of Environment Quality", "publisher": "American Society of Agronomy"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.agee.2010.01.002", "title": "Long-term monitoring of buffer zone efficiency under different cultivation techniques in boreal conditions", "journal": "Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.10.036", "title": "PSYCHIC \u2013 A process-based model of phosphorus and sediment mobilisation and delivery within agricultural catchments.

We set out why national current accounts remain important in a monetary union and examine the forces driving the current account balance. We present empirical evidence on current account developments in the Euro Area, focusing on countries in which a correction has occurred. Detailed counter-factual model-based simulations for Germany show that \u201cwage policy\u201d on its own is scarcely able to make an impact on its huge and destabilising surplus; what is needed is a combined approach in which nominal wages follow a wage norm (productivity plus ECB target inflation rate) while aggregate demand is managed (in this case stimulated) to fully utilise product...", "published_on": "2017-10-13", "added_on": "2020-09-21", "document_url": "https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/a904c5f6-b21c-11e7-837e-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=a904c5f6-b21c-11e7-837e-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/e2e0cc4ab6f34190cb91101df8d2a2e2.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/e2e0cc4ab6f34190cb91101df8d2a2e2.png", "topics": ["Economy", "Economics", "Macroeconomics", "Balance of payments", "Labour economics", "European Union", "Euro", "Economic growth", "Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union", "Eurozone", "Government spending", "Inflation", "Balance of trade", "Exchange rate", "Fiscal policy", "Current account (balance of payments)", "Fixed exchange rate system", "Monetary policy", "Finance", "Interest", "Crowds", "Sudden stop (economics)", "European debt crisis", "Real wages", "Autocorrelation", "Human activities", "European Central Bank", "Errors and residuals", "Recession", "Price", "Interest rate", "Export", "Economic equilibrium", "Government budget balance"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics", "science and technology", "science and technology>social sciences", "politics", "economy, business and finance>business information", "economy, business and finance>business information>business finance", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics>inflation", "economy, business and finance>economy", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics>deflation", "science and technology>social sciences>economics", "politics>government", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics>recession", "economy, business and finance>business information>business finance>earnings"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["KC-BD-17-059-EN-C", "KC-BD-17-059-EN-N", "10.2765/303255", "10.2765/44721", "9789279649097", "9789279649103", "2443-8022"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1504/ijpp.2011.039577", "title": "Peripheral Europe's debt and German wages: the role of wage policy in the Euro area", "journal": "International Journal of Public Policy", "publisher": "Inderscience Publishers"}, {"doi": "10.1177/102425890300900409", "title": "Trouble with EMU: fiscal policy and its implications for inter-country adjustment and the wage-bargaining process", "journal": "Transfer: European Review of Labour and Research", "publisher": "SAGE Publications"}, {"doi": "10.1353/eca.2005.0020", "title": "Global Current Account Imbalances and Exchange Rate Adjustments", "journal": "Brookings Papers on Economic Activity", "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press"}, {"doi": "10.1111/twec.12130", "title": "Austerity, Growth and Inflation: Remarks on the Eurozone's Unresolved Competitiveness Problem", "journal": "The World Economy", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1007/s10273-016-1990-4", "title": "Zur Vertiefung der wirtschaftlichen Konvergenz in der Eurozone", "journal": "Wirtschaftsdienst", "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC"}, {"doi": "10.1162/asep_a_00238", "title": "The Eurozone Crisis and the Competitiveness Legend", "journal": "Asian Economic Papers", "publisher": "MIT Press - Journals"}], "policy": [{"overton_id": "eucommission-96bd9d74c708bcd9ebbabb9b41c5a058", "title": "White paper on the future of Europe", "policy_source_id": "eucommission"}, {"overton_id": "nber-0897eabb653235dea05d59c9cc55f401", "title": "The Six Major Puzzles in International Macroeconomics: Is There a Common Cause?", "policy_source_id": "nber"}, {"overton_id": "nber-d9c457bde192f42fd81994c937cede2b", "title": "Unbalanced Trade", "policy_source_id": "nber"}], "news": [], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "achieving the broad goals of the EU set out in Article 3 of the Treaty on the EuropeanUnion TEU; these include sustainable economic growth, full employment and price stability.Moreover, the BEPGs  which involve a monitoring, reporting and policy recommendation systemsimilar to that of the Stability and Growth Pact SGP and now the MIP  provide, again in principle,the operational means to bring about a consistent macroeconomic policy-mix in the member statesoriented towards these broad welfare goals.

Careful recycling to land allows their nutrients to be used to enhance crop growth and maintain or improve soil fertility, which will usually result in large savings in the use of inorganic fertilizers. However, manures can present a considerable environmental risk if their N content is not used effectively. Recent estimates indicated that in 2007 total N excretion by livestock in the EU-27 was c. 9,100 kton, with earlier work indicating that up to 52% of the N excreted by livestock was potentially recycled as a plant nutrient, implying that up to 48% may not be recovered by crops.

Responsible AI can accelerate efforts toward health systems being more resilient, sustainable, equitable, and person-centred. This paper provides an overview of the background and current state of artificial intelligence in health, perspectives on opportunities, risks, and barriers to success. The paper proposes several areas to be explored for policy makers to advance the future of responsible AI in health that is adaptable to change, respects individuals, champions equity, and achieves better health outcomes for all.

This working paper examines how social dialogue can shape the AI transition in beneficial ways for both workers and firms. It highlights that social dialogue can generally help foster inclusive labour markets and ease technological transitions, and presents new descriptive evidence together with ongoing initiatives from social partners showing that social dialogue has an important role to play in the AI transition as well. The paper also discusses how AI adoption may affect social dialogue itself, e.g. by adding new pressures on weakening labour relations systems and posing practical challenges to social partners, such as insufficient AI-related expertise and resources to respond to the AI transition.

It focuses, in particular, on the evolution of labour demand and widespread shortages, as well as on wage developments in times of high inflation and related policies. It also takes stock of the current evidence on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the labour market. Progress in AI has been such that, in many areas, its outputs have become almost indistinguishable from that of humans, and the landscape continues to change quickly, as recent developments in large language models have shown. This, combined with the falling costs of developing and adopting AI systems, suggests that OECD countries may be on the verge of a technological revolution that could fundamentally change the workplace. While there are many potential benefits from AI, there are also significant risks that need to be urgently addressed, despite the uncertainty about the short- to medium-term evolution of AI.

This publication sheds light on the important public governance challenges countries face today in preserving and strengthening their democracies, including fighting mis- and disinformation; improving government openness, citizen participation and inclusiveness; and embracing global responsibilities and building resilience to foreign influence.

These areas lay out the foundations of the new OECD Reinforcing Democracy Initiative, which has also involved the development of action plans to support governments in responding to these challenges.", "published_on": "2022-11-17", "added_on": "2022-11-21", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1787/76972a4a-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/fadef46207cf8fa675b705fe37af0b8d.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/fadef46207cf8fa675b705fe37af0b8d.png", "topics": ["Governance", "Social media", "Media (communication)", "Misinformation", "Lobbying", "Privacy", "Democracy", "Fake news", "Disinformation", "Competition", "Transparency (behavior)", "Deepfake", "Civic space", "Policy", "OECD", "Risk", "Information", "Fact-checking", "News", "Mass media", "Media literacy", "Innovation", "Issues in ethics", "Public sphere", "Politics", "Social institutions", "Freedom of information", "Public participation", "Government", "Environmental, social, and corporate governance", "Communication", "Digital Services Act", "Freedom of speech", "Market (economics)", "E-democracy", "Research", "Online Safety Bill", "Anti-competitive practices", "European Union", "Political science", "Journalism", "COVID-19 pandemic", "Education", "Public policy", "Advertising", "Literacy", "Applied ethics", "Safety", "Public engagement", "Branches of science", "Civil society"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "politics", "economy, business and finance>economy", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>media", "science and technology"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/76972a4a-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1787/c03e01b3-en", "title": "Policy Framework on Sound Public Governance", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1080/10584609.2020.1785067", "title": "Political Polarization on the Digital Sphere: A Cross-platform, Over-time Analysis of Interactional, Positional, and Affective Polarization on Social Media", "journal": "Political Communication", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.48550/arxiv.1504.05646", "title": "The New South Wales iVote System: Security Failures and Verification Flaws in a Live Online Election", "publisher": "arXiv"}, {"doi": "10.1787/10ccbfcb-en", "title": "Evaluation Guidelines for Representative Deliberative Processes", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/8b47adfe-en", "title": "Digital inclusion", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/597f5b7f-en", "title": "Equal Access to Justice for Inclusive Growth", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264209022-en", "title": "Recommendation of the Council on Regulatory Policy and Governance", "publisher": "OECD Publishing"}, {"doi": "10.4159/9780674970342-005", "title": "5.

In comparing virtual assistants, self-driving vehicles and video recommendations for children, it is easy to see that the benefits and risks of each are very different.

To help policy makers, regulators, legislators and others characterise AI systems deployed in specific contexts, the OECD has developed a user-friendly tool to evaluate AI systems from a policy perspective. It can be applied to the widest range of AI systems across the following dimensions: People &amp; Planet; Economic Context; Data &amp; Input; AI model; and Task &amp; Output. Each of the framework's dimensions has a subset of properties and attributes to define and assess policy implications and to guide an innovative and trustworthy approach to AI as outlined in the OECD AI Principles.", "published_on": "2022-02-22", "added_on": "2022-06-14", "document_url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/cb6d9eca-en", "pdf_url": "n/a", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/3acf5dd074cf9304f02ca1703aed7ce0.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/oecddiscovery/3acf5dd074cf9304f02ca1703aed7ce0.png", "topics": ["Computing", "Cognition", "Branches of science", "Cognitive science", "Technology", "Information", "Data", "Statistical classification", "Risk", "Automation", "Risk management", "Prototype", "Personal data", "Discriminative model", "Systems development life cycle", "Life-cycle assessment", "Simulation", "Federated learning", "Generative model", "Conceptual model", "Metadata", "System", "Artificial intelligence", "Machine learning", "Technology readiness level", "Systems science", "Health", "Internet of things", "Open-source software", "General Data Protection Regulation", "Privacy", "Governance", "Support-vector machine", "Expert", "Learning", "Analytics", "Evaluation", "Deep learning", "Policy", "Unstructured data", "Artificial neural network", "Data model", "Mathematical optimization", "Research", "Robust statistics", "Concepts in metaphysics", "Forecasting", "Self-driving car", "Input/output", "Employment", "Health care", "Autonomy", "Reinforcement learning", "Determinism", "Reliability engineering", "Health technology", "Unsupervised learning", "Statistical model", "Computer science"], "dont_show_pdf": "true", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "science and technology>social sciences", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology>software", "science and technology", "science and technology>social sciences>information science"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Working paper", "other_identifiers": ["10.1787/cb6d9eca-en"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1787/d62f618a-en", "title": "Scoping the OECD AI principles", "journal": "OECD Digital Economy Papers", "publisher": "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  (OECD)"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264115644-en", "title": "The Role of Internet Intermediaries in Advancing Public Policy Objectives", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1109/aero.2015.7119313", "title": "Calibrating the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale using NASA mission data", "publisher": "IEEE"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9789264311992-en", "title": "Measuring the Digital Transformation", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/eedfee77-en", "title": "Artificial Intelligence in Society", "publisher": "OECD"}, {"doi": "10.1787/9870c393-en", "title": "How's Life?

The analyses follow from a collaboration between the Joint Research Centre\u2019s (JRCs) LUISA team, and the City of Amsterdam. The study provides insight in the spatial dynamics of Amsterdam\u2019s housing market, uncovering the driving factors behind the city\u2019s spiraling-up house prices, providing empirical support to a further development of an inclusive and accessible housing market for all. The analyses indicate that closer proximity to the city centre, older buildings, and companies as buyers, are the main determinants behind higher prices. Another main finding is that looking at asking prices, Amsterdam's middle income households would need to spend a higher share of their incomes on long-term rents, in comparison to middle class income households at country level.

The next step is to exploit the synergies between the different sensors and possibly integrate the information layers within a single product. To enable those future developments, it is essential to understand the potentials and limitations of each of the layers and identify complementarities. In these regards, the validation of built-up derived from different sensors is crucial for gaining a deeper understanding of the consistency and interoperability between them.

This development is assumed to have a negative effect on housing affordability, especially for the lower and middle classes. This study serves to get a better understanding of housing financialisation through an open\u2013minded and investigative approach, providing steppingstones for future research. The study includes three main research components (seven city case studies; advanced analyses of Amsterdam housing data; descriptive data on institutional investment in multifamily property) supported by two experts workshops.

The report also notes that while existing literature is useful in understanding attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines, the unique circumstances of the pandemic limit the generalizability of these findings.

This alternative control method is implemented through Article 40a of the implementing regulation (EU) 809/2014, and may be used since 2018. The CbM primarily relies on automatic methods to conclude on the CAP eligibility criteria, commitments and obligations from regular and systematic Copernicus Sentinel imagery.

Gerbens-Leenes (University of Twente, The Netherlands) addressed the water\nfootprint of electricity and heat.\nThe availability of fresh water of sufficient quality is an important issue on present policy\nagenda\u2019s, whereby the relation with energy security receives increasing attention. Today,\nfossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) are still the dominant energy source. In some countries,\nalso nuclear energy is important. In 2012, 70% of the global electricity generation came\nfrom thermo-electric power plants, with 11% generated in nuclear power plants. The\ngrowing demand for energy and the need to reduce the use of fossil fuels to mitigate\nglobal warming has stimulated the expansion of renewable energy, e.g. hydropower and\nwind and solar energy. Biomass is another renewable energy source, providing fuels such\nas bioethanol or biodiesel, and also electricity when used in a power plant. Although\nrenewables were often regarded as clean energy sources, there has been in the recent\nyears an increasing concern about their environmental sustainability. Such concerns\ninclude for example the large amount of water use for growing biomass.\nWater is essential to energy production. In the three stages of the energy production\nchain, the fuel supply stage, the construction stage and the operational stage, water is\nneeded. In the fuel supply stage, mining, processing and transport of fuels like coal, oil,\ngas and uranium require water. The growth of biomass (e.g. firewood) for energy\npurposes also requires water. Other energy sources \u2013 hydropower and solar, wind and\ngeothermal energy \u2013 do not have a fuel supply stage. In the construction stage, water is\nneeded for the mining and processing of materials, for example, for the materials for a\nhydropower dam or for a power plant. In the operational stage, water is needed for\nprocesses like the cooling of power plants, dust suppression (e.g. for coal) or flue gas\ndesulfurization. Also, there is water consumed through evaporation from the hydropower\nreservoirs or for the cooling of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) systems.\nA generally accepted indicator for water use is the Water Footprint (WF) that measures\nthe volume of freshwater used for a product over the full supply chain, showing water\nconsumption by source and polluted volumes by type of pollution. The blue WF measures\nconsumptive use of surface and groundwater; the green WF measures consumption of\nrainwater (most relevant in agriculture and forestry); the grey WF, not considered here,\nis an indicator of water pollution. The term \u2018consumptive WF\u2019 is used to refer to the sum\nof the blue and green WF.\nThe goal of the study reported here is to estimate the present-day and future water\nconsumption related to global electricity and heat generation and to understand\ndetermining factors, regional differences and risks posed by regional water scarcity. More\nspecifically, the study aims:\n- to quantify the consumptive WF of electricity and heat generation for different energy\nsources and technologies for the three main stages of the production chain, i.e. fuel\nsupply, construction and operation, per unit of gross energy produced and per unit of net\nenergy produced;\n- to assess the consumptive WF of electricity and heat generation per energy source per\nworld region, accounting for the different energy mixes used per region;\n- to compare, per country, the fuel production (in TJ/y) and the operational WF of\nelectricity and heat generation to the annual average monthly blue water scarcity in\norder to identify water-risk areas; and to estimate the consumptive WF in the year 2035.\nWe consider the most important energy sources: coal, lignite, natural gas, shale gas,\nconventional and unconventional oil, uranium, biomass, wind, solar, geothermal and\nhydropower. The study is based on data from literature on water consumption per unit of\nenergy for different energy sources, combined with information on electricity and heat\nproduction per energy source per country. The study identifies criticalities associated with\nwater scarcity."}]}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "domains of Agriculture and Water Sciences.

It is therefore essential to be able to determine if a plan has been effective in achieving its objectives.

In the former case, we want to be able to understand which aspects of a management plan were effective so they can be considered in the design for future plans.

It covers important aspects such as CO2 emissions and use of freshwater for cooling of power plants, and estimates their sensitivity to the changing climatic conditions.Changing weather conditions affect the operation of the European power systems. The output of renewable energy sources fluctuates depending on the availability of wind, cloud cover, or water levels in reservoirs, while the output of dispatchable generators, such as gas turbines, must be adapted accordingly to ensure that supply and demand are balanced at all times.

In the general population, exposure occurs predominately via the diet,\nbut is some cases also via the environment and medical applications (drugs and prostheses).\nExcessive exposure, in both experimental and observational studies, has been associated with\nseveral adverse health effects, primarily on the neurological, cardiovascular, and endocrine\nsystems. In pregnant women, some previous studies indicated that cobalt would partly transfer\nacross the placental barrier. However, studies concerning cobalt exposure during pregnancy\nand potential implications on pregnancy outcomes and later child health are limited. The aim of\nthe present study is to determine the exposure to cobalt in pregnant women, identify potential\nsources of exposure, and evaluate the associations with adverse pregnancy outcomes and\ninfant sensitization towards common allergens as well as child cognition. This is explored using\nthree different mother-child cohorts in different geographical locations (i.e. northern Sweden,\nGreece, and Bangladesh). The exposure to cobalt has already been determined by\nmeasurements in maternal blood and urine during pregnancy using inductively coupled plasma\nmass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In the Swedish mother-child cohort detailed questionnaires\nconcerning environmental exposures and diet will enable identification of important exposure\nsources using principal component analysis. Furthermore, the exposure biomarkers will be\nrelated to various child health outcomes in the different cohorts, i.e. pregnancy outcomes\n(preterm birth and birth anthropometry), sensitization towards common allergens, and\ncognitive function and behaviour.

The companies listed in the R&D Scoreboard hold a dominant position in KETs and AMT filings with about 61% of total KETs filings and 57% of total AMT filings in 2011. European companies hold almost 50% of the AMT related patent filings and about 50% of these are from Germany headquartered companies.

First, although important steps have been taken towards transparency in reporting CS practices, there is still significant flexibility in terms of the international sustainability frameworks that guide the reporting, the key performance indicators (KPIs) that need to be included, and even the specific aspects that must be reported. Second, there is a wide range of CS metrics rooted in different methodologies and assumptions that still lack standardization and convergence. These two challenges make it difficult to compare companies and understand their evolution towards greater sustainability. Based on these challenges in measuring and reporting CS practices, this study has two objectives: (1) analysing companies\u2019 CS reporting to determine the trends in terms of the terminology, EU regulations, international sustainability frameworks, ratings and indices, KPIs, and materiality approaches used, and (2) comparing the CS metrics of some of the most relevant rating agencies to identify their similarities and differences. To achieve these objectives, we collected data on the 250 EU companies ranked better in the 2021 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard. Overall, this work aims to contribute to advancing greater homogenisation in the measurement and reporting of CS.", "published_on": "2023-02-10", "added_on": "2023-02-15", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC132579", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC132579/JRC132579_01.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/397cbee4f1ab21c9a4f24fd1871a754e.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/397cbee4f1ab21c9a4f24fd1871a754e.png", "topics": ["RepRisk", "Environmental, social, and corporate governance", "Global Reporting Initiative", "Sustainability reporting", "Sustainability Accounting Standards Board", "Stock market index", "Sustainability", "Sustainable Development Goals", "Performance indicator", "Sustainable finance", "Corporate social responsibility", "Governance", "Risk", "Economy", "Business", "European Union", "Dow Jones Sustainability Indices", "Sustainability accounting", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Management", "Finance", "Data analysis", "Sustainalytics", "Bureau van Dijk", "Research and development", "Sustainable development", "Carbon accounting", "European Green Deal"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "environment>natural resources", "economy, business and finance>business information", "economy, business and finance>business information>human resources", "environment", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economy", "environment>natural resources>water", "economy, business and finance>business information>human resources>management"], "source_tags": ["Environment and climate change", "Information society", "Innovation and growth", "JRC corporate"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["10.2760/935191"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1111/ablj.12148", "title": "The Convergence of Financial and ESG Materiality: Taking Sustainability Mainstream", "journal": "American Business Law Journal", "publisher": "Wiley"}, {"doi": "10.1002/smj.2407", "title": "Do ratings of firms converge?

Floods reduce securitised credit in the local markets, suggesting that physical risks associated with climate change are borne within the banking sector.", "published_on": "2023-12-11", "added_on": "2023-12-13", "document_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC136274", "pdf_url": "https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC136274/JRC136274_01.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/7690ff1f2621403e27eeafcbfd543f5c.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/jointresearcheu/7690ff1f2621403e27eeafcbfd543f5c.png", "topics": ["Loan", "Risk", "Interest", "Credit", "Securitization", "Loss given default", "Fixed effects model", "Bank", "Flood", "Hazard", "Survival analysis", "Finance", "Risk premium", "Repurchase agreement", "Homoscedasticity and heteroscedasticity", "Debt", "Regression analysis", "Interest rate", "Default (finance)", "Collateral (finance)", "Climate change adaptation", "Credit risk", "Median", "Mortgage loan", "Errors and residuals", "Hazard ratio", "Valuation (finance)", "Vulnerability", "Pricing", "European Union", "Loan origination", "Coefficient of determination", "Probability of default", "Small and medium-sized enterprises", "Dependent and independent variables", "Sampling (statistics)", "Financial stability", "Statistics", "Economic growth", "Asset-backed security", "SME finance", "Economy", "Extreme weather", "Correlation", "Line of credit", "Climate change", "2007\u20132008 financial crisis", "Money", "Standard error", "European Central Bank", "Effects of climate change", "Business loan", "Parameter", "Financial fragility", "Statistical significance", "Euro", "Natural disaster", "Private sector", "Natural hazard", "Sustainable finance", "Dummy variable (statistics)", "Bond (finance)", "Gross domestic product", "Capital market", "Information", "Equation", "European DataWarehouse", "Bond market", "Standard score", "Climate resilience"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>financial and business service", "economy, business and finance>market and exchange", "economy, business and finance>market and exchange>loan market", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics", "economy, business and finance>economy", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>financial and business service>banking", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>market and exchange>loan market>loans", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics>credit and debt"], "source_tags": ["Economic and monetary Union", "Environment and climate change"], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["JRC136274"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2139/ssrn.4606293", "title": "Climate Risk, Bank Lending and Monetary Policy", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1093/rof/rfac013", "title": "Climate Change Risk and the Cost of Mortgage Credit", "journal": "Review of Finance", "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}, {"doi": "10.1093/rfs/hhz073", "title": "Does Climate Change Affect Real Estate Prices?

For this reason, there is particular interest on mobility trends over time in those countries where income inequality has recently been increasing. However, the evidence for mobility trends in more recent cohorts is as yet less conclusive.

While changes in lifestyles -mainly as regards work patterns- have decreased total urban transport activity, the gradual return to pre-pandemic levels suggests that traffic and congestion levels may soon exceed their 2019 levels. Apart from the question of total transport activity, the trends identified in this report can influence modal choice and trip distances, with possible negative repercussions in terms of transport costs, congestion and emissions. The analysis combines a range of data sources and methodologies. Changes in mobility patterns are identified using the JRC Travel Survey 2021. The evolution of traffic congestion levels is monitored through daily TomTom data from 178 cities in the EU.

Citizens\u2019 behaviour plays a key role in separate collection. Thus, it is important to understand the main behavioural factors of waste sorting and how they can be encouraged. This study presents the main findings of a literature review focused on identifying and classifying the factors underlying SWC.

The main trends in provisioning, regulating and maintenance, and cultural ecosystem services were assessed using a set of 30 indicators assorted according to the CICES classification. More crops for food, feed and energy were produced in the EU on less arable land. More organic food was grown. Textile crop production and the total number of grazing livestock decreased. Water use relative to water availability remained stable. Timber removals increased but so, too, did the total timber stock. There was an increase in net ecosystem productivity (growing biomass).

The goal is to halve nitrogen\nlosses to the environment, conceptually also covering losses induced by application of fertilizers, while\nfully maintaining soil fertility. This will result in the reduction of fertilizer use by at least 20%. To reach\nthis goal, in 2022 the European Commission will develop with Member States an Integrated Nutrient\nManagement Action Plan (INMAP), to better manage nitrogen throughout its life cycle. The JRC situated\nin Ispra collects methods and approaches to be included into the INMAP. In this context Bruna Grizzetti\n(JRC Ispra) reached out to the Co-Chairs of the Expert-Panel on Nitrogen Budgets of the Task Force\non Reactive Nitrogen (operating under CLRTAP), Wilfried Winiwarter (IIASA) and Markus Geupel (UBA).\nThe Expert Panel Co-Chairs agreed, to summarize the methodological approach of a \u201cGuidance\ndocument on national nitrogen budgets\u201d, an excellent tool to inventory all relevant nitrogen flows within\ndifferent segments of a national economy and its environmental pools, also considering cross- border\ntransport. Quantitative knowledge on flows help to identify sources and assess developments. The\nmethodology also offers opportunities for benchmarking interim milestones towards the new goal of\nhalving nitrogen losses."}, {"person": "Bruna Grizzetti", "affiliation": "Joint Research Centre", "snippet": "1 European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC) -

Approximately 20,000 points were selected out of the main LUCAS grid for the collection of soil samples. A standardised sampling procedure was used to collect around 0.5 kg of topsoil (0-20 cm). The samples were dispatched to a central laboratory for physical and chemical analyses.

This study shows that on the basis of phenomena already present in Europe today it is possible to invent a discontinuous model of how people learn and how what they learn is used in everyday life. At the core of this model is a carefully elaborated idea of learning spaces that encompass new ways of ensuring that people have the capacity to control, direct, share and deepen their knowledge throughout their lives. These multi-dimensional learning spaces are imagined as operating in a systemically different economic and social context.

The scope of this report is restricted to the economic impact of unconventional gas on energy markets. As such, it principally addresses such issues as the energy mix, energy prices, supplies, consumption, and trade flows. Whilst this study touches on coal bed methane and tight gas, its predominant focus is on shale gas, which the evidence at this time suggests will be the form of unconventional gas with the most growth potential in the short- to medium-term. This report considers the prospects for the indigenous production of shale gas within the EU-27 Member States. It evaluates the available evidence on resource size, extractive technology, resource access and market access. This report also considers the implications for the EU of large-scale unconventional gas production in other parts of the world.

The first part of this work consists in the multidisciplinary analysis (physics, chemistry, microbiology, corrosion, modelling \u2026) of corrosion deposits sampled in three European ports. Distinctions could be made between ALWC and NLWC (normal low water corrosion) in terms of physicochemical and microbiological compositions. Diversity of total and active bacterial communities was evaluated by molecular methods applied on corrosion deposits for the first time. Specific species of SRB and SOB were found to create an active sulphur cycle in ALWC corrosion deposits. In a particular case, the presence of photosynthetic micro-organisms in NLWC deposits could have influenced corrosion processes.

In this study, precipitation predictions from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather (ECMWF) seasonal forecast system (System 4) are combined with observed precipitation data to generate forecasts of the standardized precipitation index (SPI) for Latin America, and their skill is evaluated over the hincast period 1981\u20132010. The value-added utility in using the ensemble S4 forecast to predict the SPI is identified by comparing the skill of its forecasts with a baseline skill based solely on the climatological characteristics of the SPI itself. As expected, skill of the S4-generated SPI forecasts depends on the month, location, and specific index considered (the 3- and 6-month SPI were evaluated). Added skill from the S4 for lead times equaling the SPI accumulation periods is primarily in regions with high intra-annual precipitation variability, and is found mostly for the months at the end of the dry seasons for 3-month SPI, and half-yearly periods for 6-month SPI. Thus, in the near term, the largest advances in the prediction of meteorological drought for Latin America are obtainable from improvements in near-real-time precipitation observations for the region.

As outright bank failures have been rare in Europe, the paper introduces a novel dataset that complements bankruptcies and defaults with state interventions and mergers in distress. The signals of the early warning model are calibrated not only according to the policymaker's preferences between type I and II errors, but also to take into account the potential systemic relevance of each individual financial institution. The key findings of the paper are that complementing bank specific vulnerabilities with indicators for macro-financial imbalances and banking sector vulnerabilities improves model performance and yields useful out-of-sample predictions of bank distress during the current financial crisis.", "published_on": "2014-04-23", "added_on": "2020-09-21", "document_url": "https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/aac7f730-151c-4767-a5d3-2c97cf1d54c7/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=aac7f730-151c-4767-a5d3-2c97cf1d54c7&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/60c3a25412f609d134e0282d5195a2d6.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/60c3a25412f609d134e0282d5195a2d6.png", "topics": ["Finance", "Economy", "Capital adequacy ratio", "Market liquidity", "Accuracy and precision", "Credit default swap", "Interest", "Financial crisis of 2007\u201308", "Debt", "CAMELS rating system", "Bank", "Precision and recall", "Receiver operating characteristic", "European Central Bank", "Money", "Loan", "Mortgage loan", "Government debt", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Type I and type II errors", "Statistics", "Credit", "Default (finance)", "Financial services", "Equity (finance)", "Macroeconomics", "Risk", "Business", "Greek government-debt crisis", "Gross domestic product", "Stock", "Investment", "Financial capital", "Business cycle", "Security (finance)", "Inflation", "Bond (finance)", "Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure", "European Union", "Logistic regression"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>financial and business service", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics", "economy, business and finance>economy", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>financial and business service>banking", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economy>macro economics>credit and debt", "science and technology>mathematics"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["QB-AR-13-094-EN-N", "1725-2806"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.2765/20032", "title": null, "publisher": null}, {"doi": "10.2139/ssrn.1716204", "title": "Predicting Bankruptcy Using Neural Networks in the Current Financial Crisis: A Study of U.S. Commercial Banks", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.5089/9781455201297.001", "title": "Resolution of Banking Crises: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", "journal": "IMF Working Papers", "publisher": "International Monetary Fund (IMF)"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.jbankfin.2007.03.011", "title": "Bank failures and bank fundamentals: A comparative analysis of Latin America and East Asia during the nineties using bank-level data", "journal": "Journal of Banking & Finance", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1057/imfer.2011.8", "title": "Financial Crises, Credit Booms, and External Imbalances: 140 Years of Lessons", "journal": "IMF Economic Review", "publisher": "Springer Nature"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.jbankfin.2007.07.014", "title": "Comparing the performance of market-based and accounting-based bankruptcy prediction models", "journal": "Journal of Banking & Finance", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.jbankfin.2012.09.013", "title": "Impact of FDICIA internal controls on bank risk taking", "journal": "Journal of Banking & Finance", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.5089/9781451845167.001", "title": "Determinants of Ex-Ante Banking System Distress: A Macro-Micro Empirical Exploration of Some Recent Episodes", "journal": "IMF Working Papers", "publisher": "International Monetary Fund (IMF)"}, {"doi": "10.2307/3867330", "title": "The Determinants of Banking Crises in Developing and Developed Countries", "journal": "Staff Papers -

Through increased renovation of energy inefficient buildings, a reduction in energy consumption in the building sector can be achieved, as targeted by the Renovation Wave initiative. When considering the old age of the EU\u2019s building stock, next to energy inefficiency, other, often structural, deficiencies need to be addressed. Particularly in Europe\u2019s seismic regions, recent earthquakes have highlighted the vulnerability of the EU building stock and hence the need for retrofitting. With a large proportion of EU buildings requiring renovation, recent advances in scientific and technical development show that taking an integrated approach to building renovation, a better cost-effectiveness may be achieved.

To this extent, we propose a thick modelling approach, which al-lows a vast number of model specifications in a dynamic panel setting. We find that fiscal expansions are associated with an increase in household saving rate in the euro area, which supports a partial, but not full, Ricardian equivalence channel. The relationship holds regardless of how we measure the (discretionary) fiscal policy impulse. The median saving offset across all baseline specifications is around 19% in the short run and 41% in the long run. Various robustness checks underpin the basic results, while also pointing to model and estimation uncertainty and no robust evidence for total private saving offset. Our results for the euro area are broadly in line with the literature, albeit they tend to yield a somewhat weaker evidence for the saving offset of fiscal policy, particularly in relation to earlier

In animal studies the addictive potency of the final tobacco product cannot be assessed. The reinforcing potency of drugs is measured after intravenous injections and suggests that the abuse liability of pure nicotine is weaker than the addictive potential of tobacco products in humans.

It is aimed at exploring climate change adaptation scenarios as well as concrete actions to increase climatic resilience in a small European island: Tenerife, Canary Islands (Spain), the largest and most populated of the seven islands of the Canaries. The effects of climatic and non-climatic hazards on local population health and ecosystems are reviewed, such as heatwaves, air pollution and the atmospheric dust which comes from the Saharan dessert. The potential combination or overlapping effects of these hazards are also explored. According to the literature reviewed, heatwaves, air pollution, and Saharan dust events have been producing negative effects on the population, in terms of both morbidity and mortality, as well as the environment, such as forest fires related impacts. In terms of health impacts, elderly and people with chronic diseases are those more vulnerable to the previous hazards. ...", "published_on": "2017-01-19", "added_on": "2020-09-21", "document_url": "https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/6b28c9f0-dede-11e6-ad7c-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF", "pdf_url": "https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=6b28c9f0-dede-11e6-ad7c-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/a76e86ed8c953a06d006ae1cbf10ae82.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/europa/a76e86ed8c953a06d006ae1cbf10ae82.png", "topics": ["Air pollution", "Climate resilience", "Particulates", "Heat wave", "Tenerife", "Global warming", "Climate change adaptation", "Sustainability", "Dust", "Canary Islands", "Hazard", "Atmosphere of Earth", "Emergency management", "Wildfire", "Pollution", "Climate change mitigation", "San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna", "Focus group", "Wind", "Greenhouse gas", "Risk", "Hyperthermia", "Natural environment", "Governance", "Sahara", "Climate change policy of the United States", "Health", "Mineral dust", "Nature", "Human activities", "Uncertainty", "Research", "Las Palmas", "Earth sciences", "Exhaust gas", "Public health", "Environmentalism", "Ecology", "Meteorology", "Environmental governance", "Ecological resilience", "Framing (social sciences)", "Extreme weather", "Trade winds", "Qualitative research", "Black carbon", "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", "Effects of global warming", "Disease", "Transport", "Sulfur dioxide", "Climate", "Ultrafine particle", "Decision-making", "Road", "Gran Canaria", "Santa Cruz de Tenerife", "University of La Laguna", "NOx", "Water", "Politics of global warming", "Research question", "Psychological resilience", "Physical geography", "Teide", "Disaster risk reduction", "Oil refinery", "Fire", "Public transport", "Non-governmental organization", "Environmental policy", "Pollution prevention", "Ecosystem", "Risk management"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["environment>natural resources", "environment", "weather", "environment>climate change", "environment>natural resources>water", "environment>environmental pollution"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": ["LB-NA-28340-EN-C", "LB-NA-28340-EN-N", "10.2788/282252", "10.2788/8586", "9789279645952", "9789279645969", "1018-5593", "1831-9424"], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [{"doi": "10.1016/j.atmosenv.2004.05.021", "title": "Transport pathways of ozone to marine and free-troposphere sites in Tenerife, Canary Islands", "journal": "Atmospheric Environment", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.5194/acp-9-6319-2009", "title": "Atmospheric nanoparticle observations in the low free troposphere during upward orographic flows at Iza\u00f1a Mountain Observatory", "journal": "Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics", "publisher": "Copernicus GmbH"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.03.017", "title": "Study on the formation and transport of ozone in relation to the air quality management and vegetation protection in Tenerife (Canary Islands)", "journal": "Chemosphere", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.futures.2013.01.001", "title": "VISIONS for Venice in 2050: Aleph, story telling and unsolved paradoxes", "journal": "Futures", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.26754/ojs_geoph/geoph.2007511118", "title": "Cat\u00e1logo de riesgos clim\u00e1ticos en Canarias: amenazas y vulnerabilidad", "journal": "Geographicalia", "publisher": "Universidad de Zaragoza"}, {"doi": "10.3109/1354750x.2016.1160430", "title": "Short-term effects of air pollution, markers of endothelial activation, and coagulation to predict major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome: insights from AIRACOS study", "journal": "Biomarkers", "publisher": "Informa UK Limited"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.eneco.2014.04.014", "title": "Agricultural adaptation to climate change in rich and poor countries: Current modeling practice and potential for empirical contributions", "journal": "Energy Economics", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.resmic.2012.08.009", "title": "Epifluorescent direct counts of bacteria and viruses from topsoil of various desert dust storm regions", "journal": "Research in Microbiology", "publisher": "Elsevier BV"}, {"doi": "10.1080/15487733.2006.11907974", "title": "Collaboration for sustainability?

There is concern that EU fishing fleets expend vast quantities of energy and that low overall efficiency is caused by structural deficiencies and lack of knowledge on possible available solutions and improvements. This assumption highlights the need of a methodological approach and new solutions to make fisheries aware of possibilities to rise up the fishing industry.

The Commission may consult the group on any matter relating to marine and fisheries biology, fishing gear technology, fisheries economics, fisheries governance, ecosystem effects of fisheries, aquaculture or similar disciplines. This report is the fifth of a suite of STECF EWG reports dedicated to the fishing effort regime in the Western Mediterranean Sea, following EWG reports 18-09, 18-13, 19-01 and 19-14. The group was requested to progress to update mixed fisheries models and F-E analyses with the most recent data and the most recent stock assessments, to run a number of effort scenarios until 2025, to draft a mixed-fisheries advice including relevant scenarios and displays, and to discuss next steps. In EMU 1, good progresses were achieved in combining effort and catch data from both France and Spain into the bioeconomic multifleet model IAM.

One of the objectives of WP2 (Base for RECARE data collection and methods) is to provide an improved overview of existing information on soil threats and degradation at the European scale. The report is written by a group of experts from the RECARE team, coordinated by Bioforsk. In total, 60 persons were included in the process of writing, reviewing and editing the report. Eleven soil threats were identified for the report. These soil threats are soil erosion by water, soil erosion by wind, decline of organic matter (OM) in peat, decline of OM in minerals soils, soil compaction, soil sealing, soil contamination, soil salinization, desertification, flooding and landslides and decline in soil biodiversity. In the review process, the WP2 team organised a workshop on soil threats and ecosystem services to improve our understanding and knowledge on the concepts and applications of ES and soil functions.

The overall aim of this project was to deliver a test approach for the assessment of characterising odours in tobacco products, by a combination of sensory profiling, chemical-analytical measurements, other methods, or a combination of methods. The tobacco industry and the food industry in general conduct expert panel and consumer research to test the flavour and other sensory characteristics of a product for purposes of successful product development.

The main body of the report, which summarises the project methodology and key findings, is accompanied by six Annexes which give more detailed guidance and examples. The Technical Guidance includes 25 technical fiches for new and innovative climate actions. Moreover, the project developed suggestions and guidelines for potential combinations of rural development (RD) measures which could enhance synergies for climate objectives under Priority 4 and Priority 5 of RDPs.

Tensioned Membrane Structures have unique properties compared to the more conventional built environment. Besides their low self-weight and high flexibility these structures are known to be 'optimally' constructed, as they are only loaded in tension. It results in shapes adapted to the flow of forces and a minimum of material needed to realise the span. Despite a considerable amount of scientific knowledge exists, only few design codes are available. A common standardised approach as well as a comprehensive European design standard is needed in order to provide verification techniques, a common pool of design approaches and to achieve a harmonized safety level. This background document consists of three major parts: (a) general explanations giving scientific and technical background for the design of membrane structures, (b) state-of-the-art overview on existing national and European rules and recommendations on the design of membrane structures, and (c) proposals for European harmonized design rules, which could be part of the future Eurocode for Tensile Membrane Structures. The final aim is to develop a Eurocode for the Structural Design of Tensile Membrane Structures which will help to design and implement these lightweight structures. The Eurocode will not only assist and support the industry and engineering offices but will also encourage potential clients to choose these sustainable applications.", "published_on": "2016-01-26",

Finance theory has traditionally viewed derivatives as a major innovation that improves economic outcomes by completing markets and providing a means to hedge underlying risk, raising market liquidity, and improving the informational efficiency of markets. However, over the last decade, there has been growing concern in many quarters that OTC derivatives trading creates instability in underlying markets and the wider financial system.

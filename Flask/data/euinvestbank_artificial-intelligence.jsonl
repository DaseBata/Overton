Mr. Yenteeb was also helpful on many other occasions by providing data, clarifications,\nand answers to our questions on the solidarity groups. Furthermore, we thank all department heads\nand other BMC representatives for attending our first project meeting and the final presentation of\nour results. We thank the BMC credit officers that assisted our field enumerators in identifying the\nsolidarity group meeting locations and other BMC employees who helped us in a myriad ways. We are\nalso grateful to our field supervisor Mr. Abdulai Iddrisu and team of 11 enumerators (Ms. Fauzia\nIddrisu, Ms. Musah Mariam, Ms. Nathalia Konkuri, Ms. Braimah Sherifa, Ms. A\u2010isha Adamu Dufailu, Ms.\nMasona Mustapha, Ms. Fati Haruna, Ms. Fali Mustapha, Mr. Amos Nunifant, Mr. Abu M.

Finally, the support team at GDN has been no less amazing (Anindya,\nAbhay, Aarti, Mansoor, Dominic, and others). GDN staff members not only in the EIB\u2010GDN team but\nalso in other units have provided us with invaluable help in solving some of the teething problems we\nfaced in our project.

This study offers an overview of how AI can benefit future healthcare, in particular increasing the efficiency of clinicians, improving medical diagnosis and treatment, and optimising the allocation of human and technical resources. The report identifies and clarifies the main clinical, social and ethical risks posed by AI in healthcare, more specifically: potential errors and patient harm; risk of bias and increased health inequalities; lack of transparency and trust; and vulnerability to hacking and data privacy breaches. The study proposes mitigation measures and policy options to minimise these risks and maximise the benefits of medical AI, including multi-stakeholder engagement through the AI production lifetime, increased transparency and traceability, in-depth clinical validation of AI tools, and AI training and e...", "published_on": "2022-06-01", "added_on": "2022-12-07", "document_url":

However, the power for positive change that AI provides simultaneously has a potential for negative impacts on society. AI ethics work to uncover the variety of ethical issues resulting from the design, development, and deployment of AI. The question at the centre of all current work in AI ethics is: 'How can we move from AI ethics to specific policy and legislation for governing AI?' Based on a framing of 'AI as a social experiment', this study arrives at policy options for public administrations and governmental organisations who are looking to deploy AI/ML solutions, as well as the private companies who are creating AI/ML solutions for use in the public arena. The reasons for targeting this application sector concern: the need for a high standard of transparency, respect for democratic values, and legitimacy.

Data of friends of friends, collected exponentially, were passed to CA, which used that data to target online voters/users with personalised political ads, allegedly seeking to manipulate their behaviour in the 2016 UK and US polls.

One of the main questions is how to correctly capture value and tax businesses characterised by a reliance on intangible assets, no or insignificant physical presence in the tax jurisdictions where commercial activities are carried out (scale without mass), and a considerable user role in value creation. Current tax rules are struggling to cope with the emerging realities of these new economic models. The European Union (EU) and other international bodies have been discussing these issues for some time. In March 2018, the EU introduced a 'fair taxation of the digital economy' package. It contained proposals for an interim and long-term digital tax. The European Parliament supported both proposals, widening their scope and coverage and backing integration of digital tax into the proposed Council framework on corporate taxation.

NextStrain is an opensource application that tracks the evolution of viruses and bacteria, collects all the data around the world from labs that are sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and centralises them in one place in the form of a genomic tree. Researchers have also been sharing new findings about the genomic profile of the virus through open-source publications and preprint sites such as BioRxiv and Chinaxiv.

Making this data open was the first and most important data-sharing initiative that helped scientists to grow the live virus and build up a picture of how the virus is spreading. Since then, public health institutions and universities around the world have publicly shared over 183 sequences of variants of SARS-CoV-2 in a monumental effort to develop an effective vaccine against this new \u00a9 Enzozo / Shutterstock.com virus. In fact, the most important initiatives to prevent and monitor the spread of the disease have been based on an ever-growing ecosystem of open science, open-data and opensource platforms that share dashboards, information and resources of vital importance for decision-makers. For instance, public health authorities, universities and clinical laboratories are releasing genomic data from Covid-19 specimens at unprecedented speed, the WHO provides daily status reports including new cases, while more than 30 leading publishers have agreed to make all of their Covid-19-related publications immediately accessible in public repositories to openly inform the public health response. Major publishers, including Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley Online Library, Emerald and Oxford University Press, have set up a featured open access resources page. In the domain of data-sharing, open-source technologies can bring to the fore a broader set of important concepts such as accessibility of information, open standards that enable all stakeholders to contribute and rapid prototypes that can lead to rapid discoveries. In this context, several initiatives have been developed around the world to develop new low-cost and open-source designs for everything from ventilators to face shields. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32007145https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/who-audio-script-ncov-rresser-unog-29jan2020.pdf?sfvrsn=a7158807_4https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/covid-19-how-unprecedented-data-sharing-has-led-faster-ever-outbreak-research.html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/ https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615330/best-worst-coronavirus-dashboards/ https://www.wired.com/story/data-sharing-open-source-software-combat-covid-19/ https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/publishers-make-coronavirus-covid-19-content-freely-available-and-reusable", "matched_news_url": "https://www.wired.com/story/data-sharing-open-source-software-combat-covid-19/", "matched_news_outlet": "Wired Magazine"}, {"reference_string": "Researchers have used CRISPR to treat muscular dystrophy and Alzheimer's in mice, fight drug-resistant bacteria, and breed tastier tomatoes.

Doctors at the Casey Eye Institute of Oregon Health & Science University in Portland recently used CRISPR gene editing on a patient for the first time. https://www.vox.com/2020/2/28/21154930/jennifer-doudna-crispr-gene-editing-babies https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcmm.14916 https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03919-0 https://www.cbsnews.com/news/crispr-used-inside-a-humans-body-for-the-first-time-scientists-say-today-2020-03-05/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/crispr-used-inside-a-humans-body-for-the-first-time-scientists-say-today-2020-03-05/", "matched_news_outlet": "CBS"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://time.com/5793535/coronavirus-telemedicine-telehealth/", "matched_news_url": "https://time.com/5793535/coronavirus-telemedicine-telehealth/", "matched_news_outlet": "Time Magazine"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/business/masks-china-coronavirus.html", "matched_news_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/business/masks-china-coronavirus.html", "matched_news_outlet": "The New York Times"}, {"reference_string": "Data sharing and open-source initiatives face more than just technological obstacles. They are being shape d in a legal vacuum. At international level, various WHO initiatives in the field of data-sharing can provide some guidance. Examples are the 2016 Policy Statement on Data Sharing in the context of public health emergencies, the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework and its recent code of conduct for the open and timely sharing of pathogen genetic sequence data during outbreaks of infectious disease. None of these documents can generate legal obligations of information-sharing among states and/or replace the various regional or bilateral data-sharing agreements. At EU level, a report by the High-Level Expert Group on Business-to-Government Data Sharing concluded that much of the potential for private-sector data and insights to be used by public-sector bodies to tackle societal challenges remains untapped. Several organisations are currently asking the EU to ensure that all technical measures to manage the coronavirus are transparent, remain under public control and make use of free/open-source software when designing public interest applications. In a recent EU-FOSSA 2 survey, open-source communities called on the EU to help developers make software more secure and to increase the stability of their coding by supporting, and sponsoring them to work on specific aspects of their code. As there is a pressing need for an open analytics environment that allows all interested stakeholders to analyse, interpret, and share Covid-19 data, opensource initiatives could address the regrettable lack of data sharing and considerable analytical obfuscation, but also empower groups of people to share local knowledge and pool the rights they have over their data.

It is essential for individuals to understand both the strengths and limitations of this technology in the context of the relevant informed consent process.

More recently, Russian state media have also engaged in a disinformation campaign regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, using malicious reporting in an attempt to create panic and sow distrust amongst western nations, as well as undermine trust in European health care systems.

Pro-Kremlin information campaigns boost Moscow's narrative of a morally decayed EU on the brink of collapse, and seek to exploit divisions in Western societies. In November 2017, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused Russia of 'weaponising information', and a February 2018 report by UK communications agency 89up.org found Russian pro-Brexit social media interference worth up to \u20ac4.6 million during the campaign. In August 2017, the US imposed fresh sanctions on Russia over its interference in the 2016 election. Following the nerve-gas attack on a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter on UK soil in March 2018, the US imposed new sanctions, including on 16 Russian entities and individuals linked to the Internet Research Agency (a Russian 'troll factory' spreading disruptive content via social media) indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller for their role in election-meddling operations.

Furthermore, in contrast to the classical world, where a system can be measured without changing it, in the quantum world a measurement can have an impact on the state of the system.", "published_on": "2017-01-17", "added_on": "2022-12-07", "document_url": "https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_ATA(2017)581943", "pdf_url": "https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2017/581943/EPRS_ATA(2017)581943_EN.pdf", "thumbnail": "http://app.overton.io/cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/euparl_library/7f60b987487255ba8a02e7a7ed903ba9.png", "thumbnail_path": "cache_image/pdf_thumbnails/euparl_library/7f60b987487255ba8a02e7a7ed903ba9.png", "topics": ["Cryptography", "Quantum mechanics", "Quantum computing", "Quantum cryptography", "Computer", "Quantum technology", "Public-key cryptography", "RSA (cryptosystem)", "Technology", "Computing", "Physics", "Areas of computer science", "Applied mathematics", "Science", "Post-quantum cryptography", "Communication protocol", "Time", "Mechanics", "Quantum superposition", "Measurement"], "dont_show_pdf": "false", "classifications": ["economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology", "economy, business and finance", "economy, business and finance>economic sector", "science and technology>natural science", "science and technology>natural science>physics", "science and technology", "economy, business and finance>economic sector>computing and information technology>software", "science and technology>technology and engineering"], "source_tags": [], "overton_policy_document_series": "Publication", "other_identifiers": [], "languages": ["eng"], "cites": {"scholarly": [], "policy": [], "news": [{"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.wired.com/2010/02/quantum-logic-atomic-clock/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.wired.com/2010/02/quantum-logic-atomic-clock/", "matched_news_outlet": "Wired Magazine"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/hacking-cryptography-and-the-countdown-to-quantum-computing", "matched_news_url": "http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/hacking-cryptography-and-the-countdown-to-quantum-computing", "matched_news_outlet": "The New Yorker"}], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "be an uninterrupted network.

The process culminated in Trump hosting the signing of the 'Abraham Accords' at the White House in September 2020. Biden called the agreement a 'historic step to bridge divides in the Middle East'. However, his team has expressed concerns about the sale of F-35 fighter jets to the UAE, which has been enabled by the Accords. The pursuit of the 'deal of the century' \u2013 in the form of the Middle East peace plan announced by Trump at the beginning of 2020 \u2013 has further sidelined the Palestinians, following the transfer of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018, and done little to advance a two-state solution. Biden has said he would restore suspended US funding to the West Bank and Gaza, including assistance delivered through the US Agency for International Development and UN agencies. He has in the past opposed Israeli settlement construction in the occupied West Bank, and voiced support for a two-state solution. The Palestinian Authority has welcomed Biden's victory. On 8 November, its president, Mahmoud Abbas, joined Arab leaders in congratulating the future President.

Back then, when relevant legislation was limited at Member State level, the directive aimed to improve consumer protection rules for financial services sold at a distance and to consolidate the internal market by aligning rules in this area. Since its adoption, however, the legal framework and digital landscape for retail financial services has evolved significantly.

In line with the 2015 European agenda on security, and taking into account the impact of this propaganda on the radicalisation, recruitment and training of terrorists, the European Commission launched a voluntary system for tackling terrorism online, based on guidelines and recommendations. However, given the limitations of self-regulation, in September 2018 the Commission proposed a regulation on preventing the dissemination of terrorist content online through the removal of such content within one hour of being posted.

The hand-eye coordination\nalong with the visualisation skills which were needed to create prehistoric cave drawings were active\nin developing basic hunting skills in Homo sapiens and this benefited humans over the\nNeanderthals, cousins of the humans, but lacking art. It is Coss' argument that Neanderthals made\nuse of thrusting spears in order to hunt tamer prey in Eurasia, while Homo sapiens were used\nthrowing spears for more dangerous and wary game in Africa. He posits that, as a result, a larger\nparietal cortex developed in Homo sapiens; this is the region of the brain that processes visual\nimages and motor coordination. Drawing also improved skills of observation; these drawings may\nhave been used to conceptualise hunts, to evaluate the attentiveness of the prey, to make targets\nof vulnerable body areas and to enhance group cohesion through spiritual ceremonies.

This aim only seems achievable if a reduction in energy consumption supported by energy efficient technologies takes place. In principle, many innovative technologies are strongly linked with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Regarding the impact of ICT on climate change two different aspects can be distinguished. On the one hand, ICT is discussed as a technology that enables an increase in energy efficiency, a reduction of energy consumption, as well as a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in general. On the other hand, ICT are an energy consumer themselves. This STOA project aimed at assessing the net impact of ICT on energy efficiency/GHG emissions on the basis of data available in the literature and in technical documents. The main focus was on energy efficiency and energy consumption, but other sectors were examined as well.

It concludes that there is an uneven distribution in the costs of digitalisation, because of the skills-biased nature of technological change - so the challenge of the future lies in coping with rising inequality from technological change.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc in many areas of the world. The infection spreads through person-to-person contact. Transmission and prognosis, once infected, are potentially influenced by many factors, including air pollution. Studies have suggested that air pollution increases the incidence and the severity of the disease. However, the current data are too limited to be certain.

Progress at EU level was stalled in an effort to find a global solution with the OECD. In the meantime this issue been taken up by some Member States, such as France and Italy. They introduced national digital taxes, modelled largely on the Commission proposal on the digital services tax. At the July 2020 European Council meeting, EU leaders tasked the Commission with putting forward a proposal on a digital levy in the first semester of 2021, considering ongoing OECD negotiations. In her 2020 State of the Union address, President von der Leyen announced the Commission's intention to propose digital levy in 2021. As agreed in the interinstitutional agreement of 16 December 2020, this levy was due to be one of the EU budget's new 'own resources' that would contribute to paying off EU debts incurred to finance the recovery package as well as play an important role in the fair taxation of digital companies.

In the digital age, earning profit in a country no longer necessarily requires settingup factories or offices on the ground, but can be effected by offering products or services through digital platforms. This results in the difficulty of localising value creation, and as a result, the ensuing taxation questions become increasingly complicated. The issue has caused some transatlantic tensions, as the United States (US) has a very strong 'big tech' digital presence around the world. The US has raised the possibility to impose unilateral tariffs if EU countries were to go ahead with a digital levy. In its March 2021 meeting, the European Council has expressed its preference for and commitment to a global solution within the OECD framework. However, it did not rule out a unilateral EU move if a global solution was not achieved. The European Parliament adopted its position on the matter in April 2021, emphasising that the global solution was the preferred one, but not the only way forward. Multilateral talks finally resulted in an agreement at OECD level in July 2021, the details of which were finalised on 8 October 2021. In the end, all EU Member States accepted to endorse the deal and to be included in the digital taxation framework, which was endorsed by the G20 leaders' meeting in Rome on 31 October. The agreement envisages a global minimum tax rate of at least 15 % and is designed to clarify tax revenue sharing among countries for multinational companies making profits in countries without a physical presence, especially by big digital companies. In July 2021, the European Commission announced that it would suspend work on its own digital levy until the autumn to prioritise the global agreement, although under the interinstitutional agreement of 16 December 2020 this initiative was supposed to be put forward by June 2021. The OECD/G20 agreement has been welcomed by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and Commissioner Gentiloni has hailed its formal endorsement by the G20. Its implementation is envisaged in the 2022 Commission work programme. https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-to-postpone-digital-tax-proposal/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/48976/250321-vtc-euco-statement-en.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0147_EN.htmlhttps://www.oecd.org/newsroom/130-countries-and-jurisdictions-join-bold-new-framework-for-international-tax-reform.htmhttps://www.oecd.org/tax/oecd-leading-multilateral-efforts-to-address-tax-challenges-from-digitalisation-of-the-economy.htmhttps://www.ft.com/content/3e3e6a7d-67d5-437d-a7b2-29c52ce9c78fhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/52732/final-final-g20-rome-declaration.pdfhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.LI.2020.433.01.0028.01.ENGhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_21_5166https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_5247https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar%3A9fb5131e-30e9-11ec-bd8e-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_2&format=PDF", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-to-postpone-digital-tax-proposal/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/48976/250321-vtc-euco-statement-en.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0147_EN.htmlhttps://www.oecd.org/newsroom/130-countries-and-jurisdictions-join-bold-new-framework-for-international-tax-reform.htmhttps://www.oecd.org/tax/oecd-leading-multilateral-efforts-to-address-tax-challenges-from-digitalisation-of-the-economy.htmhttps://www.ft.com/content/3e3e6a7d-67d5-437d-a7b2-29c52ce9c78fhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/52732/final-final-g20-rome-declaration.pdfhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.LI.2020.433.01.0028.01.ENGhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_21_5166https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_5247https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar%3A9fb5131e-30e9-11ec-bd8e-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_2&format=PDF", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "The European Council held a debate on the regional situation in the western Balkans in March 2017.

Countries, including Turkey and Morocco, have threatened to or actually did allow migrants in large numbers to cross EU borders illegally, thereby 'weaponising migration'. Most recently, in the summer of 2021, Belarus started to fly in refugees and to direct them to Lithuania in reaction to EU sanctions, opening another migration route to the EU. At its meeting of 24-45 June 2021, the European Council condemned and rejected any attempt by third countries to 'instrumentalise migrants for political purposes'. European Council President, Charles Michel reiterated this message on 5 July and pledged solidarity with Lithuania. The situation remained charged in August, with over 4 000 migrants having crossed from Belarus into Lithuania this year (compared with 74 in 2020 and just 37 in 2019) and others arriving at the Latvian and Polish borders. Consequently, the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU organised an extraordinary videoconference meeting of interior ministers within the framework of the Council's crisis response mechanism (IPCR), a tool used by EU countries to coordinate during acute crises. Ministers expressed their solidarity with Latvia, Lithuania and Poland and voiced support for providing additional assistance at these external EU borders. In this context, on 7 October 2021, interior ministers from 12 Member States sent a letter to Margaritis Schinas, Vice-President of the European Commission, and Ylva Johansson, Commissioner for Home Affairs, asking 'to adapt the existing legal framework to the new realities'. They noted, in particular, that 'a physical barrier appears to be an effective border protection measure', and proposed that measures in this regard should be 'additionally and adequately funded from the EU budget as a matter of priority'. Following the 21-22 October European Council, President von der Leyen outlined the EU's current and future support for Member States' border management, but also stated that 'there will be no [EU] funding of barbed wire and walls'. https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-says-it-will-no-longer-stop-refugees-from-entering-europe/https://ecfr.eu/article/this-time-is-different-spain-morocco-and-weaponised-migration/https://euobserver.com/world/152305https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694201/EPRS_BRI(2021)694201_EN.pdfhttps://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/1412102714427953159https://euobserver.com/migration/152583https://euobserver.com/tickers/152632https://euobserver.com/tickers/152619https://twitter.com/EU2021SI/status/1425462408731049995https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/en/news/home-affairs-ministers-express-solidarity-with-the-eu-member-states-at-the-border-with-belarus/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/ipcr/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=0ca76056ca-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_08_12_05_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-0ca76056ca-189688461https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/media/y5uoszrv/ipcr-presidency-statement-final_18-8-2021.pdfhttps://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/07/Joint-letter_Adaptation-of-EU-legal-framework-20211007.pdf https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/media-galleries/european-council/meetings/2021-10-21-22-euco/?slide=0", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-says-it-will-no-longer-stop-refugees-from-entering-europe/https://ecfr.eu/article/this-time-is-different-spain-morocco-and-weaponised-migration/https://euobserver.com/world/152305https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694201/EPRS_BRI(2021)694201_EN.pdfhttps://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/1412102714427953159https://euobserver.com/migration/152583https://euobserver.com/tickers/152632https://euobserver.com/tickers/152619https://twitter.com/EU2021SI/status/1425462408731049995https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/en/news/home-affairs-ministers-express-solidarity-with-the-eu-member-states-at-the-border-with-belarus/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/ipcr/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=0ca76056ca-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_08_12_05_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-0ca76056ca-189688461https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/media/y5uoszrv/ipcr-presidency-statement-final_18-8-2021.pdfhttps://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/07/Joint-letter_Adaptation-of-EU-legal-framework-20211007.pdf", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "The discussions on financial solidarity and on how to fund the crisis and recovery package have not been fluid.

The Commission has called on the Member States to 'take concrete and measurable steps' to implement key toolbox measures. EU leaders discussed 5G at their meeting on 1-2 October 2020 and stressed that 'potential 5G suppliers need to be assessed on the basis of common objective criteria' and asked the Member States to send their national plans on the roll-out of 5G to the Commission to 'ensure the rapid deployment of 5G across the EU'. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-1-2019-INIT/en/pdf https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154 https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123 https://agenceurope.eu/en/bulletin/article/12414/7 https://huawei.eu/press-release/huawei-media-statement-following-publication-european-commissions-5g-security-toolbox https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_127 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45910/021020-euco-final-conclusions.pdf?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=European+Council+conclusions%2c+1-2+October+2020", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "Given the serious human, economic and social consequences of the health crisis, criticism has been directed towards the lack of overall preparedness in combatting the pandemic across the EU, and the lack of coordination among Member States at the start of the outbreak.

Recent developments, including court rulings at both EU and Member State levels alluding to the rule of law, indicate that deep divisions persist in the EU regarding the understanding of democracy and European values; observers argue that the EU's rule of law crisis is still far from being resolved. EU leaders' various discussions have not led to a solution on the issue, but rather postponed direct action at European level for the moment.

The OECD has been pursuing work under two pillars: (i) the re-allocation of some taxing rights over Multi National Enterprises to the markets where they have business activities and earn profits (ii) set a global minimum corporate tax rate that countries can use to protect their tax bases. Under pillar one, potential solutions are being examined by the Council to determine where tax should be paid and what portion of profits should be taxed. A broad outline of a unified approach on pillar one has been agreed as the basis for further negotiations at the end of January 2020, followed by the endorsement by the G20 finance ministers on 23 February 2020. However, the Commission will examine whether a directive is needed to ensure the consistent and effective implementation of pillar one at EU level. In July, the G20 Finance Ministers mandated the OECD to develop a blueprint on the design of the two pillars ahead of their next meeting on 15-16 October 2020; they were published on 12 October 2020. Under pillar two, a system will be designed to ensure that multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax. On 25 March 2021, the European Council stated the urgent need to address tax challenges resulting from digitalisation and highlighted their preference for a global solution by mid-2021 within the framework of the OECD. In June 2021, the G7 agreed on a global minimum corporate income tax rate of 15 %. The new rules would adjust taxing rights to countries where large multinational enterprises earn their profits. In October 2021, 136 countries agreed to support the tax reform, while four 13 countries have not yet backed the new two-pillar tax package. Three EU Member States (Ireland, Estonia and Hungary) recently joined the agreement; thus all Member States are now officially supporting the tax reform. In the EU, the agreement will need an EU law to be passed and that will require the unanimous agreement of all 27 Member States.

Progress on this file had slowed down however in the context of the public health crisis. This resulted not only from the limited meeting possibilities, but also from existing political sensitivities regarding the file. However, at their meeting on 1-2 October 2020, EU Heads of State or Government called for progress to be hastened. The Portuguese Presidency presented a compromise proposal in mid-April 2021, building on the 2016 proposal by the Commission and encompassing the views of Member States. The Council agreed on a common position at technical level in May 2021 and on 2 June 2021 EU ambassadors reached an agreement on a mandate for negotiations with the European Parliament on the IPI.

Countries, including Turkey and Morocco, have threatened to or actually did allow migrants in large numbers to cross EU borders illegally, thereby 'weaponising migration'. Most recently, in the summer of 2021, Belarus started to fly in refugees and to direct them to Lithuania in reaction to EU sanctions, opening another migration route to the EU. At its meeting of 24-45 June 2021, the European Council condemned and rejected any attempt by third countries to 'instrumentalise migrants for political purposes'. European Council President, Charles Michel reiterated this message on 5 July and pledged solidarity with Lithuania. The situation remained charged in August, with over 4 000 migrants having crossed from Belarus into Lithuania this year (compared with 74 in 2020 and just 37 in 2019) and others arriving at the Latvian and Polish borders. Consequently, the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU organised an extraordinary videoconference meeting of interior ministers within the framework of the Council's crisis response mechanism (IPCR), a tool used by EU countries to coordinate during acute crises. Ministers expressed their solidarity with Latvia, Lithuania and Poland and voiced support for providing additional assistance at these external EU borders. https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-says-it-will-no-longer-stop-refugees-from-entering-europe/https://ecfr.eu/article/this-time-is-different-spain-morocco-and-weaponised-migration/https://euobserver.com/world/152305https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694201/EPRS_BRI(2021)694201_EN.pdfhttps://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/1412102714427953159https://euobserver.com/migration/152583https://euobserver.com/tickers/152632https://euobserver.com/tickers/152619https://twitter.com/EU2021SI/status/1425462408731049995https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/en/news/home-affairs-ministers-express-solidarity-with-the-eu-member-states-at-the-border-with-belarus/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/ipcr/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=0ca76056ca-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_08_12_05_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-0ca76056ca-189688461https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/media/y5uoszrv/ipcr-presidency-statement-final_18-8-2021.pdf", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-says-it-will-no-longer-stop-refugees-from-entering-europe/https://ecfr.eu/article/this-time-is-different-spain-morocco-and-weaponised-migration/https://euobserver.com/world/152305https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694201/EPRS_BRI(2021)694201_EN.pdfhttps://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/1412102714427953159https://euobserver.com/migration/152583https://euobserver.com/tickers/152632https://euobserver.com/tickers/152619https://twitter.com/EU2021SI/status/1425462408731049995https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/en/news/home-affairs-ministers-express-solidarity-with-the-eu-member-states-at-the-border-with-belarus/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/ipcr/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=0ca76056ca-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_08_12_05_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-0ca76056ca-189688461https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/media/y5uoszrv/ipcr-presidency-statement-final_18-8-2021.pdf", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "The EU supports the abovementioned tax package, even though it has been working on its own digital tax to deal with the issue. In 2018, the European Commission put forward two proposals for fair and effective taxation of the digital economy: a short-term solution, to be delivered by an interim digital services tax on revenues from certain digital services, and a permanent reform of corporate tax rules, based on the concept of 'significant digital presence'. Progress at EU level was stalled in an effort to find a global solution with the OECD. In the meantime this issue has been taken up by some Member States, such as France and Italy. They introduced national digital taxes, modelled largely on the Commission proposal on the digital services tax. At the July 2020 European Council meeting, EU leaders tasked the Commission with putting forward a proposal on a digital levy in the first semester of 2021, considering ongoing OECD negotiations. In her 2020 State of the Union address, President von der Leyen announced the Commission's intention to propose digital levy in 2021. As agreed in the interinstitutional agreement of 16 December 2020, this levy was due to be one of the EU budget's new 'own resources' that would contribute to paying off EU debts incurred to finance the recovery package as well as play an important role in the fair taxation of digital companies. Despite this, the US called for EU plans for a digital levy to be withdrawn due to the global tax reform negotiations at the OECD. In July 2021, the Commission decided to stall plans for the digital levy, initially expected to be presented on 14 July 2021. https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_3564https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/company-tax/fair-taxation-digital-economy_enhttps://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000038811588&categorieLien=idhttps://kdocs.kpmg.it/Marketing_Studio/171019_Italy_Digital_Services_Tax_applicable_from_1_January_2020.pdfhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45109/210720-euco-final-conclusions-en.pdf https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.LI.2020.433.01.0028.01.ENG https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/long-term-eu-budget/2021-2027/revenue/potential-new-sources-revenue_en https://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-taxation-united-states-digital-tax-corporate-tax/ https://www.politico.eu/article/oecd-global-tax-deal-reached-g20/ https://www.euronews.com/2021/07/12/brussels-presses-pause-on-plans-for-an-eu-wide-digital-tax", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/oecd-global-tax-deal-reached-g20/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Letter-to-Vestager.pdf?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=194a035c23-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_02_06_06_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-194a035c23-189690569", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Letter-to-Vestager.pdf?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=194a035c23-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_02_06_06_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-194a035c23-189690569", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Another challenging factor during the coronavirus crisis has been the German federal constitutional court's critical ruling on the European Central Bank's bond buying programme, which has met with mixed reactions. https://www.ft.com/content/a1beda5e-5c2d-429e-a095-27728ed2d72b https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_20_846 https://www.ft.com/content/f48e3a6b-6a95-4187-8a7d-0f8dad3fbecb", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f48e3a6b-6a95-4187-8a7d-0f8dad3fbecb", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/eight-countries-led-by-austria-slam-calls-to-loosen-eu-fiscal-rules/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=dc2c9a0237-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_09_10_05_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-dc2c9a0237-189747361", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/eight-countries-led-by-austria-slam-calls-to-loosen-eu-fiscal-rules/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=dc2c9a0237-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_09_10_05_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-dc2c9a0237-189747361", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Digital taxation: In the digital age, earning profit in a country no longer necessarily requires settingup factories or offices on the ground, but can be effected by offering products or services through digital platforms. This results in the difficulty of localising value creation, and as a result, the ensuing taxation questions become increasingly complicated. The issue has caused some transatlantic tensions, as the United States (US) has a very strong 'big tech' digital presence around the world. The US has raised the possibility to impose unilateral tariffs if EU countries were to go ahead with a digital levy. In its March 2021 meeting, the European Council has expressed its preference for and commitment to a global solution within the OECD framework. However, it did not rule out a unilateral EU move if a global solution was not achieved. The European Parliament adopted its position on the matter in April 2021, emphasising that the global solution was the preferred one, but not the only way forward. Multilateral talks finally produced an agreement at OECD level in July 2021, with the details to be ironed out this autumn. The agreement envisages a global minimum tax rate of at least 15 % and is designed to clarify tax revenue sharing among countries for multinational companies making profits in countries without a physical presence, especially by big digital companies. The details of the package will probably be ironed out in October, with Hungary, Estonia and Ireland still opposed to the terms of the agreement, which creates uncertainties as regards EU-wide implementation. In July 2021, the European Commission announced that it would suspend work on its own digital levy until the autumn to prioritise the global agreement, although under the interinstitutional agreement of 16 December 2020 this initiative was supposed to be put forward by June 2021. https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-to-postpone-digital-tax-proposal/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/48976/250321-vtc-euco-statement-en.pdfhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0147_EN.htmlhttps://www.oecd.org/newsroom/130-countries-and-jurisdictions-join-bold-new-framework-for-international-tax-reform.htmhttps://www.oecd.org/tax/oecd-leading-multilateral-efforts-to-address-tax-challenges-from-digitalisation-of-the-economy.htm https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-02/europe-s-new-awkward-squad-casts-shadow-over-global-tax-deal https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.LI.2020.433.01.0028.01.ENG", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-02/europe-s-new-awkward-squad-casts-shadow-over-global-tax-deal", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-shooting/french-foreign-leaders-walk-arm-in-arm-as-millions-protest-paris-attacks-idUSKBN0KK05S20150111?utm_source=Facebook", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-shooting/french-foreign-leaders-walk-arm-in-arm-as-millions-protest-paris-attacks-idUSKBN0KK05S20150111?utm_source=Facebook", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "The discussions on financial solidarity and on how to fund the crisis and recovery package have not been fluid.

The Commission published its proposal on 27 May 2020, and the European Council agreed on the package at its meeting of 17-21 July 2020.

diplomacy ahead of the COP21 in Paris'. The principle of active European diplomacy on climate has been pursued constantly ever since, with the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) adopting successive sets of conclusions. In its February 2016 conclusions, the Foreign Affairs Council agreed on the main lines that the EU was to pursue in its efforts to counter climate change; it was to do so in close cooperation with international partners in a multilateral framework, including through development cooperation mechanisms and regular diplomatic dialogue. In 2018, EU climate diplomacy action efforts focused on the Talanoa Dialogue conducted under the auspices of the UN in preparation for the COP24 in Katowice in December 2018. In Katowice, a 'rulebook' on implementing the Paris Agreement was finally agreed, which the European Council acknowledged in its December 2018 conclusions. It has also committed to provide further guidelines on 'the overall direction and political priorities' for the EU's climate action in 2019. More recently, in December 2019, the European Council has called on the High Representative and the Commission to continue to privilege climate diplomacy as a tool allowing the Union to play a leading role worldwide in the fight against climate change. https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/03/20/conclusions-european-council/http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6061-2016-INIT/en/pdfhttps://unfccc.int/topics/2018-talanoa-dialogue-platformhttp://www.cop24.katowice.eu/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2019/633139/EPRS_ATA(2019)633139_EN.pdf https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/what-was-agreed-at-cop24-in-poland-and-why-did-it-take-so-long https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/12/14/european-council-conclusions-13-14-december-2018/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/what-was-agreed-at-cop24-in-poland-and-why-did-it-take-so-long", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Taxation has been a very visible topic in the EU in recent years.

The recommendation was published a few days after the European Council meeting. Since then, the security of 5G networks, and especially the involvement of the Chinese technology giant Huawei in building the networks, has been a widely discussed topic, notably following the move by the USA to block Huawei from its market and to encourage its allies to adopt a similar approach. On 29 January 2020, the Commission published the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity, in which it outlined a set of key actions to ensure the security of the networks, such as limiting dependency on a single supplier and assessing the risk profile of supplies. The multivendor approach has been interpreted by Huawei as meaning that it will be able to take part in building the European 5G networks. The Commission called on the Member States to 'take concrete and measurable steps' to implement key toolbox measures by the end of April 2020. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-1-2019-INIT/en/pdf https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154 https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123 https://agenceurope.eu/en/bulletin/article/12414/7 https://huawei.eu/press-release/huawei-media-statement-following-publication-european-commissions-5g-security-toolbox https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_127", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-giants-new-appeal-to-governments-please-regulate-us-11580126502", "matched_news_url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-giants-new-appeal-to-governments-please-regulate-us-11580126502", "matched_news_outlet": "The Wall Street Journal"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-budget/no-deal-in-sight-as-frugal-four-stamp-down-on-eu-budget-idUSKBN20F13X", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-budget/no-deal-in-sight-as-frugal-four-stamp-down-on-eu-budget-idUSKBN20F13X", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/pro/politico-pro-morning-trade-us-deal-brexit-hogan-in-inta/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/pro/politico-pro-morning-trade-us-deal-brexit-hogan-in-inta/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-shooting/french-foreign-leaders-walk-arm-in-arm-as-millions-protest-paris-attacks-idUSKBN0KK05S20150111?utm_source=Facebook", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-shooting/french-foreign-leaders-walk-arm-in-arm-as-millions-protest-paris-attacks-idUSKBN0KK05S20150111?utm_source=Facebook", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/business/tech-taxes-debate.html", "matched_news_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/business/tech-taxes-debate.html", "matched_news_outlet": "The New York Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bbc.com/news/44537372", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/44537372", "matched_news_outlet": "BBC News"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/pro/more-than-peanuts-eu-woos-trump-with-farming-and-industrial-concessions-phil-hogan-robert-lighthizer/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/pro/more-than-peanuts-eu-woos-trump-with-farming-and-industrial-concessions-phil-hogan-robert-lighthizer/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/pro/washington-state-moves-to-eliminate-boeing-tax-break-deemed-illegal-by-wto/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/pro/washington-state-moves-to-eliminate-boeing-tax-break-deemed-illegal-by-wto/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.ft.com/content/988d8b3e-3d0f-11ea-b232-000f4477fbca?emailId=5e564f996c3b9d0004aedb05&segmentId=2785c52b-1c00-edaa-29be-7452cf90b5a2", "matched_news_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/988d8b3e-3d0f-11ea-b232-000f4477fbca?emailId=5e564f996c3b9d0004aedb05&segmentId=2785c52b-1c00-edaa-29be-7452cf90b5a2", "matched_news_outlet": "Financial Times"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/article/us-davos-meeting-trump-trade/trump-threatens-big-tariffs-on-car-imports-from-eu-idUSKBN1ZL1GK", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-davos-meeting-trump-trade/trump-threatens-big-tariffs-on-car-imports-from-eu-idUSKBN1ZL1GK", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}], "people": []}, "highlights": [{"type": "text", "text": "topics raised by the European Council, the new Commission points out in itspolitical guidelines for the next five years that to lead the way on next-generation hyperscalers, wewill invest in blockchain, high-performance computing, quantum computing, algorithms and toolsto allow data sharing and data usage.

and on how to fund the crisis and recovery package have not been fluid. One example of this is the Eurogroup video-conference meeting in inclusive format on 7-9 April, which was originally scheduled to last for one day only but had to be prolonged. Finding an agreement between countries that were advocating for different ways to support those countries most in need proved to be more complicated than initially foreseen. The gridlock was caused mainly by differing views on 'corona bonds', which Italy in particular was backing strongly and the Netherlands was vehemently against, as well as on the macroeconomic conditions accompanying European Stability Mechanism (ESM) loans, which some countries, spearheaded by Italy, considered to be too strict. Setting up a temporary Recovery Fund also proved challenging because of differing approaches, leading EU ministers to ask the European Council for guidance. However, considering these differences in views, EU leaders decided to move the issue to the Commission's table and tasked it with analysing the exact needs and producing a proposal as rapidly as possible. The Commission published its proposal on 27 May 2020. https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/43300/200410_peg-centeno-letter-to-pec-michel_covid.pdf https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/eurogroup/2020/04/07-09/ https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/04/09/report-on-the-comprehensive-economic-policy-response-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/ https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-italy-future-germany/ https://www.ft.com/content/03eb9036-a557-4ab9-9ea5-edace5ea672b https://www.politico.eu/article/italys-conte-threatens-to-block-next-eu-summit-over-eurobonds/ https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-dombrovskis/eu-could-finance-1-5-trillion-euro-recovery-fund-with-bonds-dombrovskis-idUSKCN21W0KG https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/04/23/conclusions-by-president-charles-michel-following-the-video-conference-with-members-of-the-european-council-on-23-april-2020/ https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_940", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-dombrovskis/eu-could-finance-1-5-trillion-euro-recovery-fund-with-bonds-dombrovskis-idUSKCN21W0KG", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "As far as the external dimension is concerned, the European Council called for 'strong coordinated action through active European climate diplomacy ahead of the COP21 in Paris'. The principle of active European diplomacy on climate has been pursued constantly ever since, with the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) adopting successive sets of conclusions. In its February 2016 conclusions, the Foreign Affairs Council agreed on the main lines that the EU was to pursue in its efforts to counter climate change; it was to do so in close cooperation with international partners in a multilateral framework, including through development cooperation mechanisms and regular diplomatic dialogue. In 2018, EU climate diplomacy action efforts focused on the Talanoa Dialogue conducted under the auspices of the UN in preparation for the COP24 in Katowice in December 2018. In Katowice, a 'rulebook' on implementing the Paris Agreement was finally agreed, which the European Council acknowledged in its December 2018 conclusions. It has also committed to provide further guidelines on 'the overall direction and political priorities' for the EU's climate action in 2019. More recently, in December 2019, the European Council has called on the High Representative and the Commission to continue to privilege climate diplomacy as a tool allowing the Union to play a leading role worldwide in the fight against climate change. https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/03/20/conclusions-european-council/http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6061-2016-INIT/en/pdfhttps://unfccc.int/topics/2018-talanoa-dialogue-platformhttp://www.cop24.katowice.eu/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2019/633139/EPRS_ATA(2019)633139_EN.pdf https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/what-was-agreed-at-cop24-in-poland-and-why-did-it-take-so-long https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/12/14/european-council-conclusions-13-14-december-2018/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/what-was-agreed-at-cop24-in-poland-and-why-did-it-take-so-long", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "Regarding market access, following the request made at the March 2019 European Council, colegislators have resumed discussions on an international procurement instrument.

On 29 January 2020, the Commission published the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity, in which it outlined a set of key actions to ensure the security of the networks, such as limiting dependency on a single supplier and assessing the risk profile of supplies. The multivendor approach has been interpreted by Huawei as meaning that it will be able to take part in building the European 5G networks.

In its February 2016 conclusions, the Foreign Affairs Council agreed on the main lines that the EU was to pursue in its efforts to counter climate change; it was to do so in close cooperation with international partners in a multilateral framework, including through development cooperation mechanisms and regular diplomatic dialogue. In 2018, EU climate diplomacy action efforts focused on the Talanoa Dialogue conducted under the auspices of the UN in preparation for the COP24 in Katowice in December 2018. In Katowice, a 'rulebook' on implementing the Paris Agreement was finally agreed, which the European Council acknowledged in its December 2018 conclusions. It has also committed to provide further guidelines on 'the overall direction and political priorities' for the EU's climate action in 2019. In December 2019, the European Council has called on the High Representative and the Commission to continue to privilege climate diplomacy as a tool allowing the Union to play a leading role worldwide in the fight against climate change. More recently, Charles Michel emphasised the essential role of climate diplomacy in ensuring that the EU acts as a leader in the fight against climate change. https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/03/20/conclusions-european-council/http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6061-2016-INIT/en/pdfhttps://unfccc.int/topics/2018-talanoa-dialogue-platformhttp://www.cop24.katowice.eu/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2019/633139/EPRS_ATA(2019)633139_EN.pdf https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/what-was-agreed-at-cop24-in-poland-and-why-did-it-take-so-long https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/12/14/european-council-conclusions-13-14-december-2018/ https://www.consilium.europa.eu/fr/press/press-releases/2020/09/28/l-autonomie-strategique-europeenne-est-l-objectif-de-notre-generation-discours-du-president-charles-michel-au-groupe-de-reflexion-bruegel/?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=%22L%27autonomie+strat%c3%a9gique+europ%c3%a9enne+est+l%27objectif+de+notre+g%c3%a9n%c3%a9ration%22+-+Discours+du+pr%c3%a9sident+Charles+Michel+au+groupe+de+r%c3%a9flexion+Bruegel", "matched_news_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/what-was-agreed-at-cop24-in-poland-and-why-did-it-take-so-long", "matched_news_outlet": "The Guardian"}, {"reference_string": "International digital taxation negotiations are ongoing at OECD level, but have been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic and the United States' decision in July 2020 to withdraw from the talks.

The multivendor approach has been interpreted by Huawei as meaning that it will be able to take part in building the European 5G networks. The Commission has called on the Member States to 'take concrete and measurable steps' to implement key toolbox measures. EU leaders discussed 5G at their meeting on 1-2 October 2020 and stressed that 'potential 5G suppliers need to be assessed on the basis of common objective criteria' and asked the Member States to send their national plans on the roll-out of 5G to the Commission to 'ensure the rapid deployment of 5G across the EU'. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-1-2019-INIT/en/pdf https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154 https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123 https://agenceurope.eu/en/bulletin/article/12414/7 https://huawei.eu/press-release/huawei-media-statement-following-publication-european-commissions-5g-security-toolbox https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_127 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45910/021020-euco-final-conclusions.pdf?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=European+Council+conclusions%2c+1-2+October+2020", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51665497", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51665497", "matched_news_outlet": "BBC News"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-summit-lagarde-idUSKBN23Q1KJ", "matched_news_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-summit-lagarde-idUSKBN23Q1KJ", "matched_news_outlet": "Reuters"}, {"reference_string": "Regarding the OECD talks on tax reform, the departure of the US from the negotiations over the summer and the launch of investigations by the Office of the US Trade Representative into digital service fees in 10 countries, including a five EU Member States, have raised concerns.

The study also includes a thorough comparative economic analysis of the EAV of a series of scenarios based upon the policy options identified. The results confirm that complexity remains the main factor behind both the VAT gap and the high level of compliance costs for businesses in all scenarios. Regarding the impact of each scenario compared to the baseline in 2025, the study finds an EAV of around \u20ac39 billion for the scenario of extended cooperation with exchange of information and a one-stop shop.

On 29 January 2020, the Commission published the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity, in which it outlined a set of key actions to ensure the security of the networks, such as limiting dependency on a single supplier and assessing the risk profile of supplies. The multivendor approach has been interpreted by Huawei as meaning that it will be able to take part in building the European 5G networks. The Commission has called on the Member States to 'take concrete and measurable steps' to implement key toolbox measures. EU leaders discussed 5G at their meeting on 1-2 October 2020 and stressed that 'potential 5G suppliers need to be assessed on the basis of common objective criteria' and asked the Member States to send their national plans on the roll-out of 5G to the Commission to 'ensure the rapid deployment of 5G across the EU'. https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-1-2019-INIT/en/pdf https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154 https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123 https://agenceurope.eu/en/bulletin/article/12414/7 https://huawei.eu/press-release/huawei-media-statement-following-publication-european-commissions-5g-security-toolbox https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_127 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45910/021020-euco-final-conclusions.pdf?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=European+Council+conclusions%2c+1-2+October+2020", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-23/huawei-s-5g-networks-are-a-paralyzing-dilemma-for-the-west", "matched_news_outlet": "Bloomberg"}, {"reference_string": "Since the coronavirus crisis began, the various actors, including the IMF and the Commission, have updated their forecasts for 2020 several times, and the outlook is gloomy: the world economy will contract by 4.4 % in 2020, the biggest drop since the 1930s, and both euro area and EU GDP will take a deep dive this year with an expected decrease in output of 7.8 % and 7.4 % respectively.

The principle of active European diplomacy on climate has been pursued constantly ever since, with the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) adopting successive sets of conclusions. In its February 2016 conclusions, the Foreign Affairs Council agreed on the main lines that the EU was to pursue in its efforts to counter climate change; it was to do so in close cooperation with international partners in a multilateral framework, including through development cooperation mechanisms and regular diplomatic dialogue. In 2018, EU climate diplomacy action efforts focused on the Talanoa Dialogue conducted under the auspices of the UN in preparation for the COP24 in Katowice in December 2018. In Katowice, a 'rulebook' on implementing the Paris Agreement was finally agreed, which the European Council acknowledged in its December 2018 conclusions. It has also committed to provide further guidelines on 'the overall direction and political priorities' for the EU's climate action in 2019. In December 2019, the European Council has called on the High Representative and the Commission to continue to privilege climate diplomacy as a tool allowing the Union to play a leading role worldwide in the fight against climate change. More recently, Charles Michel emphasised the essential role of climate diplomacy in ensuring that the EU acts as a leader in the fight against climate change. Furthermore, the fight against climate change might become one of the key areas for transatlantic cooperation in the years to come, as President-elect Joe Biden has announced his intention to have the US re-join the Paris Agreement. https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/03/20/conclusions-european-council/http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6061-2016-INIT/en/pdfhttps://unfccc.int/topics/2018-talanoa-dialogue-platformhttp://www.cop24.katowice.eu/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2019/633139/EPRS_ATA(2019)633139_EN.pdf https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/what-was-agreed-at-cop24-in-poland-and-why-did-it-take-so-long https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/12/14/european-council-conclusions-13-14-december-2018/ https://www.consilium.europa.eu/fr/press/press-releases/2020/09/28/l-autonomie-strategique-europeenne-est-l-objectif-de-notre-generation-discours-du-president-charles-michel-au-groupe-de-reflexion-bruegel/?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=%22L%27autonomie+strat%c3%a9gique+europ%c3%a9enne+est+l%27objectif+de+notre+g%c3%a9n%c3%a9ration%22+-+Discours+du+pr%c3%a9sident+Charles+Michel+au+groupe+de+r%c3%a9flexion+Bruegel https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-54858638", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-54858638", "matched_news_outlet": "BBC News"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52450854", "matched_news_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52450854", "matched_news_outlet": "BBC News"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-giants-new-appeal-to-governments-please-regulate-us-11580126502", "matched_news_url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-giants-new-appeal-to-governments-please-regulate-us-11580126502", "matched_news_outlet": "The Wall Street Journal"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-5g-arson-attacks-online-theories/", "matched_news_url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-5g-arson-attacks-online-theories/", "matched_news_outlet": "Politico"}, {"reference_string": "Link in text to https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-elon-musk-free-mars-colony-constitution-space-law-legality-2020-10?r=US&IR=T", "matched_news_url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-elon-musk-free-mars-colony-constitution-space-law-legality-2020-10?r=US&IR=T", "matched_news_outlet": "Business Insider"}, {"reference_string": "Given the serious human, economic and social consequences of the health crisis, criticism has been directed at the lack of overall preparedness in combatting the pandemic across the EU and the lack of coordination among Member States at the start of the outbreak.

The higher the ratio ofpesticide and fertilizer prices on agricultural product prices, the more profitable the digital andprecision farming technologies.    4.1", "pdf_url": "https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/629214/IPOL_STU(2020)629214_EN.pdf", "pdf_title": "PDF #1", "page": "69"}]}
